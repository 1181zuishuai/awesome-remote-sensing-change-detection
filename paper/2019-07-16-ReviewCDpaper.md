    Characterizations of land-cover dynamics are among the most important applications of Earth observation data, providing insights into management, policy and science. Recent progress in remote sensing and associated digital image processing offers unprecedented opportunities to detect changes in land cover more accurately over increasingly large areas, with diminishing costs and processing time. The advent of high-spatial-resolution remote-sensing imagery further provides opportunities to apply change detection with object-based image analysis (OBIA), that is, object- based change detection (OBCD). When compared with the traditional pixel-based change paradigm, OBCD has the ability to improve the identification of changes for the geographic entities found over a given landscape. In this article, we present an overview of the main issues in change detection, followed by the motivations for using OBCD as compared to pixel-based approaches. We also discuss the challenges caused by the use of objects in change detection and provide a conceptual overview of solutions, which are followed by a detailed review of current OBCD algorithms. In particular, OBCD offers unique approaches and methods for exploiting high-spatial-resolution imagery, to capture meaningful detailed change information in a systematic and repeatable manner, corresponding to a wide range of information needs.

    土地覆盖动态特征是地球观测数据最重要的应用之一，为管理、政策和科学提供了见解。最近在遥感和相关数字图像处理方面取得的进展提供了前所未有的机会，可以更准确地检测日益扩大的地区的土地覆盖变化，同时降低成本和处理时间。高空间分辨率遥感影像的出现，进一步为基于对象的图像分析(OBIA)，即基于对象的变化检测(OBCD)，提供了应用变化检测的机会。与传统的基于像素的变化范式相比，OBCD能够改进对给定景观上发现的地理实体的变化的识别。在本文中，我们概述了变化检测中的主要问题，以及与基于像素的方法相比，使用OBCD的动机。我们还讨论了在变化检测中使用对象所带来的挑战，并提供了解决方案的概念概述，然后详细回顾了当前的OBCD算法。特别是OBCD提供了独特的方法和方法来开发高空间分辨率的图像，以系统和可重复的方式捕获有意义的详细变化信息，以满足广泛的信息需求。

    Techniques based on multi-temporal, multi-spectral, satellite-sensor-acquired data have demonstrated potential as a means to detect, identify, map and monitor ecosystem changes, irrespective of their causal agents. This review paper, which summarizes the methods and the results of digital change detection in the optical/infrared domain, has as its primary objective a synthesis of the state of the art today. It approaches digital change detection from three angles. First, the different perspectives from which the variability in ecosystems and the change events have been dealt with are summarized. Change detection between pairs of images (bi-temporal) as well as between time profiles of imagery derived indicators (temporal trajectories), and, where relevant, the appropriate choices for digital imagery acquisition timing and change interval length definition, are discussed. Second, pre-processing routines either to establish a more direct linkage between remote sensing data and biophysical phenomena, or to temporally mosaic imagery and extract time profiles, are reviewed. Third, the actual change detection methods themselves are categorized in an analytical framework and critically evaluated. Ultimately, the paper highlights how some of these methodological aspects are being fine-tuned as this review is being written, and we summarize the new developments that can be expected in the near future. The review highlights the high complementarity between different change detection methods.

    基于多时间、多光谱、卫星传感器获取的数据的技术已显示出作为一种探测、识别、绘制和监测生态系统变化的手段的潜力，而不论其因果因素如何。本文综述了光学/红外领域中数字变化检测的方法和结果，并以综合当今的技术水平为主要目标。它从三个角度进行数字变化检测。首先，从不同的角度对生态系统的可变性和变化事件进行了总结。讨论了图像对(双时间)之间的变化检测，以及图像衍生指标(时间轨迹)的时间剖面之间的变化检测，以及在相关情况下，数字图像采集定时和变化间隔长度定义的适当选择。其次，回顾了在遥感数据和生物物理现象之间建立更直接联系的预处理程序，或在时间上镶嵌图像和提取时间剖面的预处理程序。第三，将实际的变化检测方法本身分类在一个分析框架中，并进行批判性的评估。最后，本文强调了在撰写本文时如何对这些方法学方面进行微调，并总结了在不久的将来可能出现的新发展。本综述强调了不同变化检测方法之间的高度互补性。

    Accurate land cover information is required for science, monitoring, and reporting. Land cover changes naturally over time, as well as a result of anthropogenic activities. Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data-particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)-coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization. 

    科学、监测和报告需要准确的土地覆盖信息。随着时间的推移，土地覆盖会发生自然变化，这也是人为活动的结果。利用地球观测(EO)数据，可以在大范围内以一致和稳健的方式监测和绘制土地覆盖和土地覆盖变化的地图。满足一系列科学和政策信息需要的土地覆盖产品目前在不同的空间和时间尺度上定期生产。EO数据的可用性增加了，特别是来自Landsat存档的EO数据(不久将增加Sentinel-2数据)，再加上新的图像合成方法提高了计算和存储能力，使得每年可以获得大面积、无间隙的地表反射率数据产品。反过来，这些数据产品支持年度土地覆盖产品的开发，这些产品可以被变化检测输出所通知和约束。在土地覆盖映射过程中包含时间序列变化提供了关于类稳定性的信息，并提供了关于逻辑类转换的信息(包括时间和类别)。在这篇综述中，我们提出了与生成和验证时间序列的年度、大面积、土地覆盖产品相关的问题和机会，并确定了适合于将时间序列信息和其他新输入纳入土地覆盖特征描述的方法。

    Landsat data constitute the longest record of global-scale medium spatial resolution earth observation data. As a result, the current methods for large area monitoring of land cover change using medium spatial resolution imagery (10-50 m) typically employ Landsat data. Most large area products quantify forest cover change. Forests are a comparatively easy cover type to map as well as a current focus of environmental monitoring concerning the global carbon cycle and biodiversity loss. Among existing change products, supervised or knowledge-based characterization methods predominate. Radiometric correction methods vary significantly, largely as a function of geographic/algorithmic scale. For instance, products created by mosaicking per scene characterizations do not require radiometric normalization. On the other hand, methods that employ a single index or classification model over an entire study area do require radiometric normalization. Temporal updating of cover change varies between existing products as a function of regional acquisition frequency, cloud cover and seasonality. With the Landsat archive opened for free access to terrain-corrected data, future product generation will be more data intensive. Per scene, interactive analyses will no longer be viable. Coupling free and open access to large data volumes with improved processing power will result in automated image pre-processing and land cover characterization methods. Such methods will need to leverage high-performance computing capabilities in advancing the land cover monitoring discipline. Robust validation efforts will be required to quantify product accuracies in determining the optimal change characterization methodologies. 


    陆地卫星数据是全球尺度中分辨率对地观测数据最长的记录。因此，目前使用中等空间分辨率图像(10-50 m)对土地覆盖变化进行大面积监测的方法通常采用陆地卫星数据。大多数大面积产品量化了森林覆盖变化。森林是一种比较容易绘制的覆盖类型，也是目前有关全球碳循环和生物多样性丧失的环境监测的重点。在现有的变革产品中，监督或基于知识的表征方法占主导地位。辐射校正方法差别很大，很大程度上取决于地理/算法尺度。例如，通过对每个场景特征进行马赛克创建的产品不需要进行辐射标准化。另一方面，在整个研究区域内采用单一指标或分类模型的方法确实需要进行放射学归一化。覆盖变化的时间更新随区域获取频率、云量和季节性的变化而变化。随着Landsat存档文件对地形校正数据的免费访问开放，未来的产品生成将更加密集。每个场景，交互分析将不再可行。将对大数据量的免费开放访问与改进的处理能力结合起来，将产生自动化的图像预处理和土地覆盖特征描述方法。这些方法将需要利用高性能计算能力来推进土地覆盖监测规程。在确定最佳的变化描述方法时，将需要健壮的验证工作来量化产品的准确性。

    Timely and accurate change detection of Earth's surface features is extremely important for understanding relationships and interactions between human and natural phenomena in order to promote better decision making. Remote sensing data are primary sources extensively used for change detection in recent decades. Many change detection techniques have been developed. This paper summarizes and reviews these techniques. Previous literature has shown that image differencing, principal component analysis and post-classification comparison are the most common methods used for change detection. In recent years, spectral mixture analysis, artificial neural networks and integration of geographical information system and remote sensing data have become important techniques for change detection applications. Different change detection algorithms have their own merits and no single approach is optimal and applicable to all cases. In practice, different algorithms are often compared to find the best change detection results for a specific application. Research of change detection techniques is still an active topic and new techniques are needed to effectively use the increasingly diverse and complex remotely sensed data available or projected to be soon available from satellite and airborne sensors. This paper is a comprehensive exploration of all the major change detection approaches implemented as found in the literature.

    及时、准确地探测地球表面特征的变化，对于理解人类与自然现象之间的关系和相互作用，促进更好地作出决策是极其重要的。遥感数据是近几十年来广泛用于变化检测的主要数据源。已经开发了许多变化检测技术。本文对这些技术进行了综述。已有文献表明，图像差分、主成分分析和后分类比较是最常用的变化检测方法。近年来，光谱混合分析、人工神经网络和地理信息系统与遥感数据的集成已成为变化检测应用的重要技术。不同的变化检测算法各有优缺点，没有一种方法是最优的，适用于所有情况。在实践中，经常会比较不同的算法，以便为特定的应用程序找到最佳的变化检测结果。变化探测技术的研究仍然是一个积极的课题，需要新的技术来有效地利用日益多样化和复杂的遥感数据，这些数据可用或不久将可从卫星和机载传感器获得。本文是对文献中所有主要的变化检测方法的全面探索。

    Detecting regions of change in multiple images of the same scene taken at different times is of widespread interest due to a large number of applications in diverse disciplines, including remote sensing, surveillance, medical diagnosis and treatment, civil infrastructure, and underwater sensing. This paper presents a systematic survey of the common processing steps and core decision rules in modern change detection algorithms, including significance and hypothesis testing, predictive models, the shading model, and background modeling. We also discuss important preprocessing methods, approaches to enforcing the consistency of the change mask, and principles for evaluating and comparing the performance of change detection algorithms. It is hoped that our classification of algorithms into a relatively small number of categories will provide useful guidance to the algorithm designer.

    由于在遥感、监测、医学诊疗、民用基础设施、水下传感等多个学科中有着广泛的应用，在不同时间拍摄的同一场景的多幅图像中检测区域的变化引起了广泛的兴趣。本文系统介绍了现代变化检测算法中常用的处理步骤和核心决策规则，包括显著性和假设检验、预测模型、阴影模型和背景建模。我们还讨论了重要的预处理方法，增强变化掩码一致性的方法，以及评价和比较变化检测算法性能的原则。希望我们将算法分类成相对较少的类别，为算法设计者提供有用的指导。

    The appetite for up-to-date information about earth's surface is ever increasing, as such information provides a base for a large number of applications, including local, regional and global resources monitoring, land-cover and land-use change monitoring, and environmental studies. The data from remote sensing satellites provide opportunities to acquire information about land at varying resolutions and has been widely used for change detection studies. A large number of change detection methodologies and techniques, utilizing remotely sensed data, have been developed, and newer techniques are still emerging. This paper begins with a discussion of the traditionally pixel- based and (mostly) statistics-oriented change detection techniques which focus mainly on the spectral values and mostly ignore the spatial context. This is succeeded by a review of object-based change detection techniques. Finally there is a brief discussion of spatial data mining techniques in image processing and change detection from remote sensing data. The merits and issues of different techniques are compared. The importance of the exponential increase in the image data volume and multiple sensors and associated challenges on the development of change detection techniques are highlighted. With the wide use of very-high-resolution (VHR) remotely sensed images, object-based methods and data mining techniques may have more potential in change detection.

    对有关地球表面的最新资料的需求日益增加，因为这些资料为大量的应用提供了基础，包括地方、区域和全球资源监测、土地覆盖和土地利用变化监测以及环境研究。遥感卫星的数据提供了以不同分辨率获取土地信息的机会，并已广泛用于变化探测研究。利用遥感数据已经发展了大量的变化探测方法和技术，新的技术仍在出现。本文首先讨论了传统的基于像素和(大部分)面向统计的变化检测技术，这些技术主要关注光谱值，而忽略了空间上下文。这之后是对基于对象的变化检测技术的回顾。最后对遥感数据空间数据挖掘技术在图像处理和变化检测中的应用进行了简要的探讨。比较了不同技术的优缺点和存在的问题。强调了图像数据量指数级增长的重要性，以及多个传感器和相关挑战对变化检测技术的发展的重要性。随着高分辨率遥感图像的广泛应用，基于对象的方法和数据挖掘技术在变化检测方面可能具有更大的潜力。

    State of the art reviews of remote sensing change detection are becoming increasingly complicated and disparate due to an ever growing list of techniques, algorithms and methods. To provide a clearer, synoptic view of the field this review has organised the literature by the unit of analysis and the comparison method used to identify change. This significantly reduces the conceptual overlap present in previous reviews giving a succinct nomenclature with which to understand and apply change detection workflows. Under this framework, several decades of research have been summarised to provide an overview of current change detection approaches. Seven units of analysis and six comparison methods were identified and described highlighting the advantages and limitations of each within a change detection workflow. Of these, the pixel and post-classification change methods remain the most popular choices. In this review we extend previous summaries and provide an accessible description of the field. This supports future research by placing a clear separation between the analysis unit and the change classification method. This separation is then discussed, providing guidance for applied change detection research and future benchmarldng experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

    由于越来越多的技术、算法和方法，遥感变化检测的最新研究进展正变得越来越复杂和不同。为了对这一领域提供一个更清晰的、概括性的观点，本综述通过分析单元和用于识别变化的比较方法组织了文献。这极大地减少了以前评审中出现的概念重叠，提供了一个简洁的术语来理解和应用变化检测工作流。在这个框架下，总结了几十年的研究，为当前的变化检测方法提供了一个概述。确定并描述了7个分析单元和6个比较方法，突出了每个方法在变化检测工作流中的优点和局限性。其中，像素和分类后变化方法仍然是最流行的选择。在本综述中，我们扩展了以前的摘要，并提供了该领域的可访问描述。这通过在分析单元和变化分类方法之间建立一个清晰的分离来支持未来的研究。然后讨论了这种分离，为应用变化检测研究和未来的基准测试实验提供了指导。

    The free and open access to all archived Landsat images in 2008 has completely changed the way of using Landsat data. Many novel change detection algorithms based on Landsat time series have been developed We present a comprehensive review of four important aspects of change detection studies based on Landsat time series, including frequencies, preprocessing, algorithms, and applications. We observed the trend that the more recent the study, the higher the frequency of Landsat time series used. We reviewed a series of image preprocessing steps, including atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud shadow detection, and composite/fusion/metrics techniques. We divided all change detection algorithms into six categories, including thresholding, differencing, segmentation, trajectory classification, statistical boundary, and regression. Within each category, six major characteristics of different algorithms, such as frequency, change index, univariate/multivariate, online/offline, abrupt/gradual change, and sub-pixel/pixel/spatial were analyzed. Moreover, some of the widely-used change detection algorithms were also discussed. Finally, we reviewed different change detection applications by dividing these applications into two categories, change target and change agent detection. 

    2008年对所有存档的陆地卫星图像的免费和开放访问彻底改变了使用陆地卫星数据的方式。本文综述了基于Landsat时间序列的变化检测研究的四个重要方面，包括频率、预处理、算法和应用。我们观察到的趋势是，研究越近，使用Landsat时间序列的频率越高。我们回顾了一系列的图像预处理步骤，包括大气校正、云和云阴影检测以及复合/融合/度量技术。我们将所有的变化检测算法分为阈值化、差分、分割、轨迹分类、统计边界和回归六类。在每个类别中，分析了不同算法的6个主要特征，如频率、变化指数、单变量/多变量、在线/离线、突变/渐变、亚像素/像素/空间。此外，还讨论了一些应用广泛的变化检测算法。最后，我们将不同的变化检测应用程序划分为变化目标和变化代理检测两类，并对它们进行了回顾。


10. Liu S, Marinelli D, Bruzzone L, et al. **A Review of Change Detection in Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images: Current Techniques, Applications, and Challenges**[J]. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 2019, 7(2): 140-158.  

    The expected increasing availability of remote sensing satellite hyperspectral (HS) images provides an important and unique data source for Earth observation (EO). HS images are characterized by a detailed spectral sampling (i.e., very high spectral resolution) over a wide spectral wavelength range, which makes it possible to monitor land-cover dynamics at a fine spectral scale. This is due to its capability of detecting subtle spectral variations in multitemporal images associated with land-cover changes that are not detectable in traditional multispectral (MS) images because of their limited spectral resolution (i.e., sufficient for representing only abrupt, strong changes in the spectral signature, as a rule). To fully exploit the available multitemporal HS images and their rich information content in change detection (CD), it is necessary to develop advanced automatic techniques that can address the complexity of the extraction of change information in an HS space. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the CD problem in HS images, as well as a survey on the main CD techniques available for multitemporal HS images. We review both widely used methods and new techniques proposed in the recent literature. The basic concepts, categories, open issues, and challenges related to CD in HS images are discussed and analyzed in detail. Experimental results obtained using state-of-the-art approaches are shown, to illustrate relevant concepts and problems.

    遥感卫星高光谱(HS)图像的可获得性日益提高，为地球观测(EO)提供了一个重要而独特的数据源。HS图像的特征是详细的光谱采样(即，非常高的光谱分辨率)在一个很宽的光谱波长范围内，这使得在一个精细的光谱尺度上监测土地覆盖动态成为可能。这是由于它能够检测与土地覆盖变化相关的多时x相图像的细微光谱变化，而传统多光谱(MS)图像由于其有限的光谱分辨率(即，通常只足以表示光谱特征中突然的、强烈的变化)。为了充分利用现有的多时相HS图像及其丰富的变化检测(CD)信息内容，有必要开发先进的自动技术来解决HS空间中变化信息提取的复杂性。本文对HS图像中的CD问题进行了全面的概述，并对用于多时相HS图像的主要CD技术进行了概述。我们回顾了近年来广泛使用的方法和新技术。对HS图像中CD的基本概念、分类、存在的问题和面临的挑战进行了详细的讨论和分析。实验结果表明，使用最先进的方法，以说明相关的概念和问题。
