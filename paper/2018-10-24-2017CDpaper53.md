1. Bertoluzza M, Bruzzone L, Bovolo F. **A novel framework for bi-temporal change detection in image time series**[C]//2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS). IEEE, 2017: 1087-1090.

    Change detection (CD) between a pair of images is a popular problem in remote sensing. Despite a large amount of data is acquired every day by remote sensing satellites, standard CD methods usually consider only the two target images between which we desire to detect changes. The aim of this work is to present a novel framework in which the bi-temporal CD is redefined by evaluating the consistency of the changes occurred in the target image pair with all the other changes of images within the considered time series. Our approach evaluates pixel-wise the changes in temporal closed-loops that include the two target images where the resulting binary change/no-change sequences can be processed by strategies inspired to the error-control-coding theory. Unreliable CD results for the target images can be identified and corrected. The experimental results on both a synthetic and a real dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

    一对图像之间的变化检测(CD)是遥感领域的一个热点问题。尽管遥感卫星每天获取大量的数据，但标准的CD方法通常只考虑我们希望检测变化的两幅目标图像。本工作的目的是提出一个新的框架，通过评估目标图像对中所发生的变化与所考虑的时间序列中所有其他图像变化的一致性，重新定义双时相CD。我们的方法从像素的角度评估时间闭环的变化，包括两个目标图像，其中产生的二进制变化/无变化序列可以通过受错误控制编码理论启发的策略来处理。对于目标图像，不可靠的CD结果可以被识别和纠正。实验结果表明了该框架的有效性。

    In this article, we propose a novel difference image (DI) creation method for unsupervised change detection in multi-temporal multi-spectral remote-sensing images based on deep learning theory. First, we apply deep belief network to learn local and high-level features from the local neighbour of a given pixel in an unsupervised manner. Second, a back propagation algorithm is improved to build a DI based on selected training samples, which can highlight the difference on changed regions and suppress the false changes on unchanged regions. Finally, we get the change trajectory map using simple clustering analysis. The proposed scheme is tested on three remote-sensing data sets. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show its superior performance compared to the traditional pixel-level and texture-level-based approaches.

    Increasing population, rapid urbanization, quest for biofuels, pollution, diseases, and adverse climate changes are some of the major drivers behind the changing surface of our planet. Timely monitoring and assessment of these changes, along with dissemination of accurate information, is important for policy makers, city planners, and humanitarian relief workers. Advances in remote sensing technologies have led to acquisition of very high resolution remote sensing imagery in the past decade. This data is highly useful for the aforementioned applications, and machine learning technology can be used to identify and quantify the changed regions. In this study we explore a semi-supervised deep generative model for change detection in very high resolution multispectral and bitemporal imagery. We constructed an auxiliary variational autoencoder that infers class labels without incurring high sample complexity costs. The resulting classifier was able to produce accurate predictions of real changes over images that appear significantly different due to environmental conditions (not real changes) while utilizing only a small set of labeled samples.

    不断增长的人口、快速的城市化、对生物燃料的追求、污染、疾病和不利的气候变化是地球表面变化背后的一些主要驱动力。及时监测和评估这些变化，以及传播准确的信息，对决策者、城市规划者和人道主义救济工作人员都是重要的。遥感技术的进步导致在过去十年中获得了非常高分辨率的遥感图像。这些数据对于前面提到的应用程序非常有用，机器学习技术可以用来识别和量化变化的区域。在本研究中，我们探讨了一个半监督的深度生成模型，用于高分辨率的多光谱和双时相图像的变化检测。我们构造了一个辅助的变分自编码器，它可以推断类标签而不会产生高的样本复杂度代价。由此产生的分类器能够准确预测由于环境条件(不是真实的变化)而出现显著差异的图像上的真实变化，而只使用一小组标记的样本。

4.	Descals, A., et al. (2017). "**Automated Detection of Selective Logging Using SmallSat Imagery**." IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters 14(12): 2180-2184.

    We propose an automated processing workflow to detect and classify changes in bitemporal very high-resolution (VHR) SmallSat imagery. The workflow consists of two preprocessing steps: an image registration method with a cross correlation approach and, second, a radiometric normalization based on regression of automatically detected invariant pixels using the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) method. The IR-MAD method also transforms pairs of registered images and detects the pixels of change. Finally, we distinguish different types of change using a clustering algorithm on the original spectral values as well as on the values resulting from different image transformations. We applied this workflow to SkySat images of Rennell Island (Solomon Islands) to detect selective logging and subsequent regrowth within a conservation area. We show how the use of VHR SmallSat images enables the detection of selective logging in the tropics, where significant cloud cover and the small extent of disturbances can prevent detection using data from traditional earth-orbiting platforms. The fine temporal resolution data from SmallSat constellations can generate enough valid observations to rapidly detect disturbances (even when cloud cover is frequent) and partial recovery. In addition, SkySat imagery provides sufficiently high spatial resolution to detect crown-level changes such as those from selective logging. Our change detection workflow is fast and highly accurate, and will be increasingly useful as the data flow from earth-observation sources increases.

    我们提出了一种自动处理流程来检测和分类双时相高分辨率(VHR)小卫星图像的变化。该工作流由两个预处理步骤组成:一种基于互相关方法的图像配准方法和第二种基于迭代重加权多元变化检测(IR-MAD)方法对自动检测到的不变像素进行回归的辐射归一化。IR-MAD方法还可以转换成对的注册图像并检测变化的像素。最后，我们使用聚类算法对原始光谱值以及不同图像变换后的值区分不同类型的变化。我们将此工作流程应用到伦内尔岛(所罗门群岛)的SkySat图像中，以检测在保护区内的选择性采伐和随后的再生。我们展示了VHR SmallSat图像的使用如何能够检测热带地区的选择性测井，在热带地区，显著的云层覆盖和小范围的干扰可以阻止使用传统地球轨道平台的数据进行检测。来自小卫星星座的精细时间分辨率数据可以产生足够有效的观测结果，从而快速检测扰动(即使是在频繁云层覆盖的情况下)和部分恢复。此外，SkySat图像提供了足够高的空间分辨率来检测冠层的变化，例如来自选择性日志记录的变化。我们的变化检测工作流程是快速和高精度的，随着来自地球观测源的数据流量的增加，它将变得越来越有用。

    Marine reclamation plays an increasingly important role in expanding living space, which should be monitored to ensure legitimate development. In this paper, a patch-based recurrent neural network is developed for change detection of marine reclamation. To capture spatial difference of image patches in two images, a patch-based recurrent neural network is proposed to extract features, where patches from two multi-spectral images are stacked as a sequence for inputting. After training the deep network, Softmax classifier is applied to detect the changed region. It is illustrated that our network can obtain the difference of two images to improve detection accuracies. Experiments on the study area of the Jinzhou Bay demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches.

    Change detection can be treated as a generative learning procedure, in which the connection between bitemporal images and the desired change map can be modeled as a generative one. In this letter, we propose an unsupervised change detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which has the ability of recovering the training data distribution from noise input. Here, the joint distribution of the two images to be detected is taken as input and an initial difference image (DI), generated by traditional change detection method such as change vector analysis, is used to provide prior knowledge for sampling the training data based on Bayesian theorem and GAN's min-max game theory. Through the continuous adversarial learning, the shared mapping function between the training data and their corresponding image patches can be built in GAN's generator, from which a better DI can be generated. Finally, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is used to analyze the better DI to obtain the desired binary change map. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

    Ternary change detection aims to detect changes and group the changes into positive change and negative change. It is of great significance in the joint interpretation of spatial-temporal synthetic aperture radar images. In this study, sparse autoencoder, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and unsupervised clustering are combined to solve ternary change detection problem without any supervison. Firstly, sparse autoencoder is used to transform log-ratio difference image into a suitable feature space for extracting key changes and suppressing outliers and noise. And then the learned features are clustered into three classes, which are taken as the pseudo labels for training a CNN model as change feature classifier. The reliable training samples for CNN are selected from the feature maps learned by sparse autoencoder with certain selection rules. Having training samples and the corresponding pseudo labels, the CNN model can be trained by using back propagation with stochastic gradient descent. During its training procedure, CNN is driven to learn the concept of change, and more powerful model is established to distinguish different types of changes. Unlike the traditional methods, the proposed framework integrates the merits of sparse autoencoder and CNN to learn more robust difference representations and the concept of change for ternary change detection. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of theproposed framework. 

    三元变化检测的目的是检测变化，并将变化分为正变化和负变化。这对联合解释时空合成孔径雷达图像具有重要意义。本研究将稀疏自编码、卷积神经网络(CNN)和无监督聚类相结合，解决无监督的三元变化检测问题。首先，利用稀疏自编码将对数比差图像转换为合适的特征空间，提取关键变化，抑制异常值和噪声。然后将学习到的特征聚类为三类，作为训练CNN模型的伪标签作为变化特征分类器。在具有一定选择规则的稀疏自编码学习特征图的基础上，选取可靠的CNN训练样本。通过训练样本和相应的伪标签，利用随机梯度下降的反向传播对CNN模型进行训练。在训练过程中，推动CNN学习变革的概念，建立更强大的模型来区分不同类型的变革。与传统方法不同，该框架融合了稀疏自编码和CNN的优点，学习了更鲁棒的差分表示和变化的概念，用于三元变化检测。实际数据集的实验结果验证了该框架的有效性和优越性。

    With the rapid technological development of various satellite sensors, high-resolution remotely sensed imagery has been an important source of data for change detection in land cover transition. However, it is still a challenging problem to effectively exploit the available spectral information to highlight changes. In this paper, we present a novel change detection framework for high-resolution remote sensing images, which incorporates superpixel-based change feature extraction and hierarchical difference representation learning by neural networks. First, highly homogenous and compact image superpixels are generated using superpixel segmentation, which makes these image blocks adhere well to image boundaries. Second, the change features are extracted to represent the difference information using spectrum, texture, and spatial features between the corresponding superpixels. Third, motivated by the fact that deep neural network has the ability to learn from data sets that have few labeled data, we use it to learn the semantic difference between the changed and unchanged pixels. The labeled data can be selected from the bitemporal multispectral images via a preclassification map generated in advance. And then, a neural network is built to learn the difference and classify the uncertain samples into changed or unchanged ones. Finally, a robust and high-contrast change detection result can be obtained from the network. The experimental results on the real data sets demonstrate its effectiveness, feasibility, and superiority of the proposed technique.

    随着各种卫星传感器技术的飞速发展，高分辨率遥感影像已成为陆地覆被过渡变化探测的重要数据来源。然而，如何有效地利用现有的光谱信息来突出变化仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。提出了一种基于超像素变化特征提取和神经网络分层差分表示学习的高分辨率遥感图像变化检测框架。首先，利用超像素分割生成高度同质和紧凑的图像超像素，使这些图像块很好地遵守图像边界。其次，提取变化特征，利用光谱、纹理和空间特征表示相应超像素之间的差异信息。第三，由于深层神经网络具有从标记数据较少的数据集中学习的能力，我们使用它来学习变化和未变化像素之间的语义差异。通过预先生成的预分类图，可以从双通道多光谱图像中选择标记数据。然后，建立一个神经网络来学习差异，并将不确定样本分为变化样本和未变化样本。最后，从网络中得到了鲁棒的、高对比度的变化检测结果。实际数据集的实验结果表明了该方法的有效性、可行性和优越性。

    Change detection techniques for remote sensing images are increasingly applied to many fields, such as disaster monitoring, vegetation coverage analysis and so on. How to improve the accuracy of detection has been a critical topic that confuse the researchers for a long time. In this paper, a method combining multiscale segmentation and fusion for high-resolution images is presented. The strategy of multiscale segmentation is to segment the same image several times under different scales, and then extract the features of objects. After, the features are used as inputs of change detection. The final results are achieved by decision-level fusion. The experiments show that, comparing with other typical methods, the method proposed in this paper has a superior performance in change detection for high-resolution images.

10.	Guo, Z. and S. Du (2017). "**Mining parameter information for building extraction and change detection with very high-resolution imagery and GIS data**." Giscience & Remote Sensing 54(1): 38-63.

    Although much efforts have been made to develop automatic methods for building extraction from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery during the past 30years; the methods with high performance are still unavailable due to the three issues: uncertainty of segmentation scales, selection of effective features, and sample selection. In this study, by introducing GIS data, a parameter mining approach is proposed to (1) mine parameter information for building extraction, and (2) detect changes of buildings between VHR imagery and GIS data. For the first target, the learning mechanism is proposed for identifying optimal segmentation scales, feature subsets, and samples. For the second target, the discovered information (i.e., optimal segmentation scales, feature subsets, and selected samples) is applied to classify the VHR imagery with a multilevel random forest (RF) classifier. The proposed approach is validated on two datasets: Dataset 1 and Dataset 2. The knowledge of building extraction is first learned from Dataset 1 and then used to classify both datasets, and change detection is conducted on Dataset 1. Results of change detection in Dataset 1 indicate that the false alarm ratio and omission error of increased buildings are 20.1% and 8.4%, while the false alarm ratio and omission error of destroyed buildings are 19.1% and 11.3%, respectively. Results of building extraction in Dataset 2 revealed scores of 81.50% and 81.09% at pixel- and object-based evaluation levels. Accordingly, our proposed method is successful in building extraction and change detection.
    
    尽管在过去的30年里，人们已经做了很多努力来开发从高分辨率(VHR)图像中提取建筑物的自动方法;由于分割尺度的不确定性、有效特征的选取和样本的选取三个方面的原因，目前还没有一种高效的分割方法。本研究通过引入GIS数据，提出了一种参数挖掘方法(1)挖掘用于建筑物提取的参数信息，(2)检测VHR图像与GIS数据之间建筑物的变化。针对第一个目标，提出了识别最优分割尺度、特征子集和样本的学习机制。对于第二个目标，所发现的信息(即采用多级随机森林(RF)分类器对VHR图像进行分类。在数据集1和数据集2上验证了该方法的有效性。首先从数据集1中学习构建提取的知识，然后将其用于对两个数据集进行分类，并对数据集1进行变化检测。数据集1的变化检测结果表明，增建建筑物的虚警率和漏报率分别为20.1%和8.4%，而被毁建筑物的虚警率和漏报率分别为19.1%和11.3%。在第2数据集中进行的建筑物提取结果显示，基于像素和对象的评价水平得分分别为81.50%和81.09%。因此，我们提出的方法在建筑物提取和变化检测方面是成功的。

    In this letter, we address the problem of change detection for remote sensing images from the perspective of visual saliency computation. The proposed method incorporates low-rank-based saliency computation and deep feature representation. First, multilevel convolutional neural network (CNN) features are extracted for superpixels generated using SLIC, in which a fixed-size CNN feature can be formed to represent each superpixel. Then, low-rank decomposition is applied to the change features of the two input images to generate saliency maps that indicate change probabilities of each pixel. Finally, binarized change map can be obtained with a simple threshold. To deal with scale variations, a multiscale fusion strategy is employed to produce more reliable detection results. Extensive experiments on Google Earth and GF-2 images demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

    本文从视觉显著性计算的角度研究了遥感图像的变化检测问题。该方法结合了基于低秩的显著性计算和深度特征表示。首先，对使用SLIC生成的超像素提取多级卷积神经网络(CNN)特征，形成一个固定大小的CNN特征来表示每个超像素。然后对两个输入图像的变化特征进行低秩分解，生成表示每个像素变化概率的显著性映射。最后，用一个简单的阈值即可得到二值化的变化图。为了处理尺度变化，采用多尺度融合策略，使检测结果更加可靠。在谷歌地球和GF-2图像上的大量实验证明了该方法的可行性和有效性。

    An urban new construction land parcel detection method based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and built-up area presence index is proposed for high-resolution remote sensing images. The method consists of three main steps: construction land detection using NDVI and PanTex, false change removal, and new construction land parcel extraction. More specifically, a change proportion index is raised to convert the pixel-based change detection map to parcels in combination with a segmentation process. From experimental results validated using two cases of high-resolution optical satellite images, the proposed method is demonstrated to be efficient and achieves a per-object overall accuracy rate beyond 95%, significantly superior to the traditional postclassification change detection method. Furthermore, the proposed method avoids errors resulting from classification in the method of postclassification comparison. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

    Megacities have evolved at an unprecedented rate under the pressure of urban population growth and economic development, particularly in the developing countries. For instance, many cities in China are experiencing a large number of rapid but subtle changes resulting from urban infrastructure construction. Information concerning such small changes is imperative for understanding the local environment and human activity, and can also provide key insights for urban planners. Undoubtedly, high-resolution remotely sensed data should play an essential role for the monitoring of such subtle changes, due to the improved observation capacity of the spatial details. However, few studies have investigated high-resolution data for change detection at a large geographic scale, due to the multi-temporal heterogeneity of the data, e.g., spatial mis-registration, parallax distortion for high architectures, and the different viewing angles. In this study, we attempted to fill this gap and resolve these problems by the use of multi-view ZY-3 satellite data, which are used to generate multi-temporal orthographic images through photogrammetric derivation. In the meantime, we present a general framework for precise urban change analysis in a multi-level ( pixel, grid, and city block) approach. Two typical Chinese megacities-Beijing and Wuhan-are chosen in the experiments. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed multi-level method for monitoring subtle urban changes, achieving Kappa coefficients of similar to 0.8 at the pixel level and a correctness of 93-95% at the grid level. The landscape analysis further indicates that the rapid urban construction led to greater fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity of buildings and decreased minimum distance between building patches ( by similar to 1.0 m between 2012 and 2013). Moreover, the performances of ZY-3 and Landsat for the monitoring of subtle urban changes are compared, revealing that the high-resolution sensor-ZY-3 ( 2.5 m)-is essential for precisely detecting subtle urban changes, whereas the Landsat data ( 30 m) are not sensitive to most of the subtle changes that occur in the urban areas.

    大城市在城市人口增长和经济发展的压力下，特别是在发展中国家，以前所未有的速度发展。例如，由于城市基础设施建设，中国许多城市正在经历大量快速而微妙的变化。有关这些微小变化的信息对于了解当地环境和人类活动是必不可少的，也可以为城市规划者提供关键的洞见。毋庸置疑，高分辨率遥感数据对于这种细微变化的监测是必不可少的，因为它提高了空间细节的观测能力。然而，由于数据具有时空异质性，如空间配准不当、高层建筑视差失真、视角不同等，因此很少有研究对高分辨率数据进行大地理尺度的变化检测。在本研究中，我们试图利用ZY-3多视点卫星数据来填补这一空白，并解决这些问题。同时，我们提出了一个用于多层次(像素、网格和城市块)精确分析城市变化的一般框架。在实验中选择了两个典型的中国大城市——北京和武汉。结果验证了本文提出的多层次城市细微变化监测方法的准确性，像素级Kappa系数接近0.8，网格级Kappa系数的正确性为93-95%。景观分析进一步表明，快速的城市建设导致建筑碎片化程度和空间异质性加大，建筑斑块之间的最小距离减小(2012 - 2013年约为1.0 m)。此外,ZY-3的表演和陆地卫星监测的微妙的城市变化比较,显示高分辨率sensor-ZY-3(2.5米)是必不可少的精确检测的城市变化,而陆地卫星数据(30米)不敏感的细微变化发生在城市地区。(C) 2017年爱思唯尔公司保留所有权利。

    By taking advantages of fine details obtained by the improved spatial resolution, very high- resolution images are promising for detecting change regions and identifying change patterns. However, high overlaps between different change patterns and the complexities of multiclass classification make it difficult to reliably separate change features. A framework named simultaneous change region and pattern identification (SCRAPI) is proposed for simultaneously detecting change regions and identifying change patterns, whose components are aimed at capturing overlaps between change patterns and reducing overlaps driven by user-specific interests. To validate the effectiveness of SCRAPI, a supervised approach is illustrated within this framework, which starts with modeling the relationship between change features by interclass couples and intraclass couples, followed by metric learning where structural sparsity is captured by the mixed norm. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

    通过利用通过改进的空间分辨率获得的精细细节的优点，高分辨率的图像有望用于检测变化区域和识别变化模式。但是，不同变化模式之间的高重叠以及多类分类的复杂性使得难以可靠地分离变化特征。提出了一种名为同时变化区域和模式识别（SCRAPI）的框架，用于同时检测变化区域和识别变化模式，其组成部分旨在捕获变化模式之间的重叠并减少由用户特定兴趣驱动的重叠。为了验证 SCRAPI 的有效性，在该框架中说明了监督方法，其首先是通过类间和类内对变化特征之间的关系进行建模，然后是度量学习，其中结构稀疏性由混合规范捕获。实验证明了所提方法的有效性。 


15.	Hytla, P. C., et al. (2017). "**Multiratio fusion change detection with adaptive thresholding**." Journal of Applied Remote Sensing 11.

    A ratio-based change detection method known as multiratio fusion (MRF) is proposed and tested. The MRF framework builds on other change detection components proposed in this work: dual ratio (DR) and multiratio (MR). The DR method involves two ratios coupled with adaptive thresholds to 
    maximize detected changes and minimize false alarms. The use of two ratios is shown to outperform the single ratio case when the means of the image pairs are not equal. MR change detection builds on the DR method by including negative imagery to produce four total ratios with adaptive thresholds. Inclusion of negative imagery is shown to improve detection sensitivity and to boost detection performance in certain target and background cases. MRF further expands this concept by fusing together the ratio outputs using a routine in which detections must be verified by two or more ratios to be classified as a true changed pixel. The proposed method is tested with synthetically generated test imagery and real datasets with results compared to other methods found in the literature. DR is shown to significantly outperform the standard single ratio method. MRF produces excellent change detection results that exhibit up to a 22% performance improvement over other methods from the literature at low false-alarm rates. 

    提出了一种基于比值的多比值融合(MRF)变化检测方法。MRF框架建立在本工作中提出的其他变化检测组件的基础上:双比(DR)和多比(MR)。DR方法包括两个比率和自适应阈值，以最大化检测到的变化和最小化错误警报。结果表明，当图像对的均值不相等时，两种比率的使用优于单一比率的情况。MR变化检测建立在DR方法的基础上，通过包含负像来产生四个具有自适应阈值的总比率。研究表明，在特定的目标和背景情况下，包含负像可以提高检测灵敏度，提高检测性能。MRF进一步扩展了这一概念，它使用一个例程将比率输出融合在一起，在这个例程中，检测必须经过两个或多个比率的验证才能被分类为一个真正的变化像素。利用综合生成的测试图像和真实数据集对该方法进行了测试，并与文献中其他方法进行了比较。DR的表现明显优于标准的单比值法。MRF产生了优秀的变化检测结果，与文献中其他方法相比，在低误报率下，MRF的性能提高了22%。

Space-borne remote-sensing images are one of the main sources for change detection. Various change detection methods have been proposed on remote-sensing applications. However, often, no single efficient method can be selected for a case study because the existing methods sometimes have good performance and sometimes perform poorly. Therefore, it is necessary to propose an integrated change detection method according to some change detection methods. Multi- criteria decision analysis is a powerful framework that can integrate several criteria that may be in contrast to each other. In this study, a multi-criteria decision analysis framework was used to integrate the spectral, textural, and transformed features for detecting building changes with the help of high spatial resolution satellite images. First, the spectral, textural, and transformed features were extracted from the pre- and post-event satellite images. Second, the spectral, textural, and transformed factor maps were produced by entering the related features to three separate Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). Third, the ANFIS model was used again to integrate the mentioned factor maps for producing the preliminary building change map. And finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the proper parameters of the ANFIS models leading to accurate change detection results. The proposed method was tested on the earthquake data set of Bam City in Iran. The achieved results indicated an overall accuracy of 89.62% for identifying the changed and unchanged building regions. Moreover, the obtained results proved the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method with respect to other implemented methods regarding the Bam earthquake. Furthermore, the aggregation of the spectral, transformed, and textural features resulted in improving the change detection accuracy by about 5-15%, compared with the accuracy of every one of them for the mentioned purpose.

    地面目标的变化检测可以为地学、应急管理、城市管理、农林等领域的专家提供必要和宝贵的信息。星载遥感图像是变化检测的主要来源之一。在遥感应用中提出了多种变化检测方法。然而，由于现有方法有时性能很好，有时性能很差，因此常常无法为案例研究选择单一有效的方法。因此，有必要根据一些变化检测方法，提出一种集成的变化检测方法。多准则决策分析是一个功能强大的框架，它可以集成多个相互对立的准则。本研究利用多准则决策分析框架，结合光谱特征、纹理特征和转换特征，利用高空间分辨率的卫星图像检测建筑物的变化。首先，从事件前后的卫星图像中提取光谱特征、纹理特征和变换特征。其次，通过输入三个独立的基于自适应网络的模糊推理系统(ANFIS)的相关特征，生成光谱、纹理和转换因子图。再次利用ANFIS模型对上述因子图进行整合，生成初步的建筑变化图。最后，对ANFIS模型进行了全面的敏感性分析，确定了合适的参数，从而得到准确的变化检测结果。该方法在伊朗巴姆市地震数据集上进行了测试。所取得的结果显示，识别已变化和未变化的建筑区域的整体准确率为89.62%。结果表明，与其它方法相比，该方法具有较高的计算效率和精度。此外，将光谱特征、变换特征和纹理特征聚合在一起，可以将变化检测精度提高约5-15%，而上述三种特征的检测精度都可以达到上述目的。

    Change detection is defined as the process that helps in determining the changes associated with land use and land cover properties with reference to georegistered multitemporal remote sensing data. A unique idea of integrating sparse fusion with constrained clustering has been attempted to detect changes in multitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images in a framework called ASCC (to be pronounced as "ask"). Unlike the other traditional methods of change detection, this approach focuses on the fusion of difference images followed by a semisupervised clustering to construct a change detection map in binary form. An enhanced sparse representation is adopted to improve the performance of the fusion process by creating a locally adaptive dictionary that extracts patches from the two difference images. The reconstruction of the fused image is performed using maximum absolute coefficients of the learned dictionary. The resultant fused image is subjected to the change detection process through constrained clustering to discern the changed pixels from the unchanged pixels. To evaluate the designed solution, the method is quantified through percentage correct classification and the process is compared with the existing methods of clustering such as kappa-means, adaptive kappa-means, fuzzy C-means, and enhanced constrained kappa-means. The simulation results demonstrated that the designed approach performed better when compared with state-of-art change detection methods for detecting changes in multitemporal images. 

    变化检测被定义为地理配准的多时相遥感数据，帮助确定与土地利用和土地覆盖特性相关的变化的过程。在一个称为ASCC(发音为“ask”)的框架中，尝试将稀疏融合与约束聚类相结合的独特思想来检测多时间和多光谱遥感图像的变化。与其他传统的变化检测方法不同，该方法侧重于对不同图像进行融合，然后进行半重叠聚类，以二进制形式构造变化检测图。采用增强稀疏表示，通过创建局部自适应字典从两幅不同图像中提取小块，提高融合过程的性能。利用学习字典的最大绝对系数对融合后的图像进行重建。通过约束聚类对融合后的图像进行变化检测，将变化的像素与不变的像素进行区分。为了评价设计的解，通过百分比正确分类对方法进行量化，并与现有的聚类方法如kappa-means、自适应kappa-means、模糊C-means、增强约束kappa-means进行了比较。仿真结果表明，与现有的多时间图像变化检测方法相比，该方法具有更好的检测性能。

    Automatic monitoring of changes on the Earth's surface is an intrinsic capability and simultaneously a persistent methodological challenge in remote sensing, especially regarding imagery with very- high spatial resolution (VHR) and complex urban environments. In order to enable a high level of automatization, the change detection problem is solved in an unsupervised way to alleviate efforts associated with collection of properly encoded prior knowledge. In this context, this paper systematically investigates the nature and effects of class distribution and class imbalance in an unsupervised binary change detection application based on VHR imagery over urban areas. For this purpose, a diagnostic framework for sensitivity analysis of a large range of possible degrees of class imbalance is presented, which is of particular importance with respect to unsupervised approaches where the content of images and thus the occurrence and the distribution of classes are generally unknown a priori. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a general technique to evaluate model transferability in any two-class classification problem. The applied change detection approach is based on object-based difference features calculated from VHR imagery and subsequent unsupervised two-class clustering using k-means, genetic k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) clustering. The results from two test sites with different structural characteristics of the built environment demonstrated that classification performance is generally worse in imbalanced class distribution settings while best results were reached in balanced or close to balanced situations. Regarding suitable accuracy measures for evaluating model performance in imbalanced settings, this study revealed that the Kappa statistics show significant response to class distribution while the true skill statistic was widely insensitive to imbalanced classes. In general, the genetic k-means clustering algorithm achieved the most robust results with respect to class imbalance while the SOM clustering exhibited a distinct optimization towards a balanced distribution of classes.

    自动监测地球表面的变化是遥感的一项内在能力，同时也是一项长期的方法挑战，特别是对具有非常高空间分辨率(VHR)和复杂城市环境的图像。为了实现高水平的自动化，变化检测问题以一种无监督的方式解决，以减轻与收集正确编码的先验知识相关的工作。在此背景下，本文系统地研究了基于VHR图像的城市非监督二值变化检测应用中类分布和类不平衡的性质及其影响。为此目的，提出了一个诊断框架，用于对可能存在的大范围的类不平衡程度进行敏感性分析，这对于非监督方法尤其重要，因为在这种方法中，图像的内容以及类的发生和分布通常是先验未知的。此外，该框架还可以作为评价任何两类分类问题模型可移植性的通用技术。应用的变化检测方法是基于VHR图像计算出的基于对象的差异特征，然后使用k-均值、遗传k-均值和自组织映射(SOM)聚类进行无监督两类聚类。两个不同建筑环境结构特征的测试场地的结果表明，在不平衡的类分布设置下，分类性能一般较差，而在平衡或接近平衡的情况下，分类性能达到最佳。关于在不平衡环境下评估模型性能的合适的准确性度量，本研究表明，Kappa统计量对班级分布有显著的响应，而真实技能统计量对班级不平衡普遍不敏感。一般来说，遗传k-均值聚类算法在类不平衡方面的鲁棒性最强，而SOM聚类算法对类的均衡分布有明显的优化。

    Monitoring of changes is one of the most important inherent capabilities of remote sensing. The steadily increasing amount of available very-high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery requires highly automatic methods and thus, largely unsupervised concepts for change detection. In addition, new procedures that address this challenge should be capable of handling remote sensing data acquired by different sensors. Thereby, especially in rapidly changing complex urban environments, the high level of detail present in VHR data indicates the deployment of object-based concepts for change detection. This paper presents a novel object-based approach for unsupervised change detection with focus on individual buildings. First, a principal component analysis together with a unique procedure for determination of the number of relevant principal components is performed as a predecessor for change detection. Second, k-means clustering is applied for discrimination of changed and unchanged buildings. In this manner, several groups of object-based difference features that can be derived from multi-temporal VHR data are evaluated regarding their discriminative properties for change detection. In addition, the influence of deviating viewing geometries when using VHR data acquired by different sensors is quantified. Overall, the proposed workflow returned viable results in the order of kappa statistics of 0.8-0.9 and beyond for different groups of features, which demonstrates its suitability for unsupervised change detection in dynamic urban environments. With respect to imagery from different sensors, deviating viewing geometries were found to deteriorate the change detection result only slightly in the order of up to 0.04 according to kappa statistics, which underlines the robustness of the proposed approach.
    
    监测变化是遥感最重要的固有能力之一。不断增加的甚高分辨率遥感图像需要高度自动化的方法，因此，变化检测在很大程度上需要无监督的概念。此外，应对这一挑战的新程序应该能够处理不同传感器获得的遥感数据。因此，特别是在快速变化的复杂城市环境中，VHR数据中呈现的高水平的细节表明了部署基于对象的概念来进行变化检测。提出了一种新的基于对象的非监督变化检测方法，该方法主要针对单个建筑物。首先，主成分分析和确定相关主成分数量的独特程序作为变化检测的前身。其次，采用k-均值聚类方法对变化和未变化的建筑进行判别。通过这种方式，可以从多个时间VHR数据派生出若干组基于对象的差异特征，并根据这些特征的鉴别特性进行变化检测。此外，还量化了不同传感器采集的VHR数据对观测几何偏差的影响。总体而言，所提出的工作流对于不同的特征组，按照kappa统计量0.8-0.9及以上的顺序返回了可行的结果，证明了该工作流适用于动态城市环境中的无监督变化检测。对于来自不同传感器的图像，根据kappa统计量，观测几何偏差对变化检测结果的影响仅略大于0.04，说明了该方法的鲁棒性。

    This paper proposes a multi-texture change detection method by integrating macro-and micro- texture features. Macro-textures are related to the information defined by the whole image scene, while micro-textures describe distributions and relationships of the gray levels within a local window. Moreover, we propose two strategies, random forests (RF) and a fuzzy set model, to integrate different characteristics of the textures. Experiments were conducted on ZY-3 (the first civilian high-resolution stereo mapping satellite of China) orthographic images of the cities of Wuhan and Tokyo, as well as WorldView-2 multi-spectral images of the city of Kuala Lumpur. Results showed that the wavelet-based features obtained the highest accuracy among the macro- textures, while the morphological attributes obtained the best results for the micro-textures. By integrating both micro-and macro-textures, the texture combination using both RF and a fuzzy set model can further improve the accuracy of change detection.

    Monitoring urban expansion dynamically using remote sensing technology is an essential method for obtaining and understanding urban spatial structure. However, the quality of traditional optical images in some areas is poor due to clouds and fog. Compared to optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can achieve earth observations without the limits of sunlight and weather conditions, but its speckle is too obvious. This paper combined the advantages of pixel-level optical image and SAR image time series and proposed a spatiotemporal fuzzy clustering (STFC) strategy for urban expansion monitoring. This strategy includes three parts: 1) the construction of optical-SAR image mixed time series; 2) a time-series fuzzy information granulation method to ascertain change nodes; and 3) STFC to determine the change types and range. In our study, 13 TM images and 25 SAR scenes taken from 2005 to 2011 were selected as raw data. We used the proposed method to monitor the urban expansion of Chengdu, China, and then, analyzed its main causes according to the monitoring results. The results suggested that: 1) the proposed methods could effectively extract the change nodes and change pixels, with the correctness of 85.20% and the completeness of 86.06%, outperforming the time series only (nonspatial) fuzzy clustering method, as well as traditional classification methods; and 2) the urban expansion of Chengdu is most apparent from 2005 to 2011,with the expansion direction shifting from the traditional ring structure expansion to point-axis expansion following the priority given to construction of new urban areas.

    This article proposes an unsupervised change-detection method using spectral and texture information for very-high-resolution (VHR) remote-sensing images. First, a new local-similarity- based texture difference measure (LSTDM) is defined using a grey-level co-occurrence matrix. A mathematical analysis shows that LSTDM is robust with respect to noise and spectral similarity. Second, the difference image is generated by integrating the spectral and texture features. Then, the unsupervised change-detection problem in VHR remote-sensing images is formulated as minimizing an energy function related with changed and unchanged classes in the difference image. A modified expectation-maximization based active contour model (EMCVM) is applied to the difference image to separate the changed and unchanged regions. Finally, two different experiments are performed with SPOT-5 images and compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised change- detection methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can sufficiently increase the robustness with respect to noise and spectral similarity and obtain the highest accuracy among the methods addressed in this article.

    In this letter, we propose a change detection method based on Gabor wavelet features for very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, Gabor wavelet features are extracted from two temporal VHR images to obtain spatial and contextual information. Then, the Gabor-waveletbased difference measure (GWDM) is designed to generate the difference image. In GWDM, a new local similarity measure is defined, in which the Markov random field neighborhood system is incorporated to obtain a local relationship, and the coefficient of variation method is applied to discriminate contributions from different features. Finally, the fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm is employed to obtain the final change map. Experiments employing QuickBird and SPOT5 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    In this paper, the change detection of Multi-Spectral (MS) remote sensing images is treated as an image segmentation issue. An unsupervised method integrating histogram-based thresholding and image segmentation techniques is proposed. In order to overcome the poor performance of thresholding techniques for strongly overlapped change/non-change signals, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with three components, including non-change, non-labeling and change, is adopted to model the statistical characteristics of the different images between two multi-temporal MS images. The non-labeling represents the pixels that are difficult to be classified. A random walk based segmentation method is applied to solve this problem, in which the different images are modeled as graphs and the classification results of GMM are imported as the labeling seeds. The experimental results of three remote sensing image pairs acquired by different sensors suggest a superiority of the proposed approach comparing with the existing unsupervised change detection methods.

    A novel multiscale morphological compressed change vector analysis (M(2)C(2)VA) method is proposed to address the multiple-change detection problem (i.e., identifying different classes of changes) in bitemporal remote sensing images. The proposed approach contributes to extend the state-of-the-art spectrum-based compressed change vector analysis (C(2)VA) method by jointly analyzing the spectral-spatial change information. In greater details, reconstructed spectral change vector features are built according to a morphological analysis. Thus more geometrical details of change classes are preserved while exploiting the interaction of a pixel with its adjacent regions. Two multiscale ensemble strategies, i.e., data level and decision level fusion, are designed to integrate the change information represented at different scales of features or to combine the change detection results obtained by the detector at different scales, respectively. A detailed scale sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate its impacts on the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is designed in an unsupervised fashion without requiring any ground reference data. The proposed M(2)C(2)VA is tested on one simulated and three real bitemporal remote sensing images showing its properties in terms of different image size and spatial resolution. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness.

    In this paper, a structural conditional random field framework (SCRF) is proposed to detect the detailed change information from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. Traditional random field based methods encounter the over-smoothing problem when deal with HSR images and the boundary of changed objects cannot be preserved well. To solve this problem, in SCRF, fuzzy c means (FCM) is used to model the unary potential while avoiding the independent assumption. Pairwise potentials with different shapes are selected as the structural set to model the spatial features of land cover such as buildings and roads. Based on SCRF, a set of change belief maps are generated to describe the observed image from different aspects. An object based fusion strategy is then followed to combine the belief maps to get the refined result. The results of the proposed method on two HSR data sets outperform some state-of-art algorithms.

    Change detection is an increasingly important research topic in remote sensing application. Previous studies achieved land cover change detection (LCCD) using bi-temporal remote sensing images. However, many widely used methods detected change depending on a series of parameters, and determining parameters is time-consuming. Furthermore, numerous methods are data-dependent. Therefore, their degree of automation should be improved significantly. Three techniques, which consist of a semi-automatic change detection system, are proposed for LCCD to overcome the abovementioned drawbacks. The three techniques are as follows: (1) change magnitude image (CMI) noise reduction is based on Gaussian filter (GF), which is coupled with OTSU for reducing CMI noise automatically using an iterative optimization strategy; (2) a method based on histogram curve fitting is suggested to predict the threshold range for parameter determination; and (3) a modified region growing algorithm is built for iteratively constructing the final change detection map. The detection accuracies of the proposed system are investigated through four experiments with different bi-temporal image scenes. Compared with several widely used change detection methods, the proposed system can be applied to detect land cover change with high accuracy and flexibility. This work is an attempt to provide a change detection system that is compatible with remote sensing images with high and median-low spatial resolution.

    变化检测是遥感应用中一个日益重要的研究课题。以往的研究利用双时间遥感图像实现了土地覆盖变化检测(LCCD)。然而，许多被广泛使用的方法都是根据一系列参数来检测变化的，而确定参数是非常耗时的。此外，许多方法都依赖于数据。因此，其自动化程度应得到显著提高。为了克服上述缺点，提出了三种基于半自动化变化检测系统的LCCD技术。三种方法分别是:(1)基于高斯滤波器(GF)的变幅图像(CMI)降噪，并结合OTSU采用迭代优化策略自动降噪;(2)提出了一种基于直方图曲线拟合的参数确定阈值范围预测方法;(3)建立改进的区域增长算法，迭代构造最终的变化检测图。通过四个不同双时间图像场景的实验，研究了该系统的检测精度。与目前广泛使用的几种变化检测方法相比，该系统可用于土地覆被变化的检测，具有较高的精度和灵活性。本工作试图提供一种与高、中、低空间分辨率遥感图像兼容的变化检测系统。

The 2016 Contest was an open topic competition based on a multitemporal and multimodal dataset, which included a temporal pair of very high resolution panchromatic and multispectral Deimos-2 images and a video captured by the Iris camera on-board the International Space Station. The problems addressed and the techniques proposed by the participants to the Contest spanned across a rather broad range of topics, and mixed ideas and methodologies from the remote sensing, video processing, and computer vision. In particular, the winning team developed a deep learning method to jointly address spatial scene labeling and temporal activity modeling using the available image and video data.

    Building change information extracted from remote sensing imageries is important for various applications such as urban management and marketing planning. The goal of this work is to develop a methodology for automatically capturing building changes from remote sensing imageries. Recent studies have addressed this goal by exploiting 3-D information as a proxy for building height. In contrast, because in practice it is expensive or impossible to prepare 3-D information, we do not rely on 3-D data but focus on using only RGB aerial imageries. Instead, we employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract effective features, and improve change detection accuracy in RGB remote sensing imageries. We consider two aspects of building change detection, building detection and subsequent change detection. Our proposed methodology was tested on several areas, which has some differences such as dominant building characteristics and varying brightness values. On all over the tested areas, the proposed method provides good results for changed objects, with recall values over 75 % with a strict overlap requirement of over 50% in intersection-over-union (IoU). When the IoU threshold was relaxed to over 10%, resulting recall values were over 81%. We conclude that use of CNNs enables accurate detection of building changes without employing 3-D information.

    This article presents a novel object-based change detection (OBCD) approach in high-resolution remote-sensing images by means of combining segmentation optimization and multi-features fusion. In the segmentation optimization, objects with optimized boundaries and proper sizes are generated by object intersection and merging (OIM) processes, which ensures the accurate information extraction from image objects. Within multi-features fusion and change analysis, the Dempster and Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm are implemented, which effectively utilize multidimensional features besides avoiding the selection of an appropriate change threshold. The main advantages of our proposed method lie in the improvement of object boundary and the fuzzy fusion of multi-features information. The proposed approach is evaluated using two different high-resolution remote-sensing data sets, and the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    In order to fully consider the local spatial constraints between neighboring objects in object-based change detection (OBCD), an OBCD approach is presented by introducing a refined Markov random field (MRF). First, two periods of images are stacked and segmented to produce image objects. Second, object spectral and textual histogram features are extracted and G-statistic is implemented to measure the distance among different histogram distributions. Meanwhile, object heterogeneity is calculated by combining spectral and textual histogram distance using adaptive weight. Third, an expectation-maximization algorithm is applied for determining the change category of each object and the initial change map is then generated. Finally, a refined change map is produced by employing the proposed refined object-based MRF method. Three experiments were conducted and compared with some state-of-the-art unsupervised OBCD methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains the highest accuracy among the methods used in this paper, which confirms its validness and effectiveness in OBCD.

    An object-based method is proposed in this paper for change detection in urban areas with multi- sensor multispectral (MS) images. The co-registered bi-temporal images are resampled to match each other. By mapping the segmentation of one image to the other, a change map is generated by characterizing the change probability of image objects based on the proposed change feature analysis. The map is then used to separate the changes from unchanged areas by two threshold selection methods and k-means clustering (k = 2). In order to consider the multi-scale characteristics of ground objects, multi-scale fusion is implemented. The experimental results obtained with QuickBird and IKONOS images show the superiority of the proposed method in detecting urban changes in multi-sensor MS images.

    The detection of damaged building regions is crucial to emergency response actions and rescue work after a disaster. Change detection methods using multi-temporal remote sensing images are widely used for this purpose. Differing from traditional methods based on change detection for damaged building regions, semantic scene change can provide a new point of view since it can indicate the land-use variation at the semantic level. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for detecting damaged building regions based on semantic scene change in a visual Bag-of-Words model. Pre-and post-disaster scene change in building regions are represented by a uniform visual codebook frequency. The scene change of damaged and non-damaged building regions is discriminated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. An evaluation of experimental results, for a selected study site of the Longtou hill town of Yunnan, China, which was heavily damaged in the Ludian earthquake of 14 March 2013, shows that this method is feasible and effective for detecting damaged building regions. For the experiments, WorldView-2 optical imagery and aerial imagery is used.

36.	Wang, B., et al. (2017). "**Image Fusion-Based Land Cover Change Detection Using Multi- Temporal High-Resolution Satellite Images**." Remote Sensing 9(8).

    Change detection is usually treated as a problem of explicitly detecting land cover transitions in satellite images obtained at different times, and helps with emergency response and government management. This study presents an unsupervised change detection method based on the image fusion of multi-temporal images. The main objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of unsupervised change detection from high-resolution multi-temporal images. Our method effectively reduces change detection errors, since spatial displacement and spectral differences between multi- temporal images are evaluated. To this end, a total of four cross-fused images are generated with multi-temporal images, and the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) method-a measure for the spectral distortion of change information-is applied to the fused images. In this experiment, the land cover change maps were extracted using multi-temporal IKONOS-2, WorldView-3, and GF-1 satellite images. The effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other unsupervised change detection methods is demonstrated through experimentation. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 80.51% and 97.87% for cases 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method performed better when differentiating the water area from the vegetation area compared to the existing change detection methods. Although the water area beneath moderate and sparse vegetation canopy was captured, vegetation cover and paved regions of the water body were the main sources of omission error, and commission errors occurred primarily in pixels of mixed land use and along the water body edge. Nevertheless, the proposed method, in conjunction with high-resolution satellite imagery, offers a robust and flexible approach to land cover change mapping that requires no ancillary data for rapid implementation.

    Post-classification with multi-temporal remote sensing images is one of the most popular change detection methods, providing the detailed "from-to" change information in real applications. However, due to the fact that it neglects the temporal correlation between corresponding pixels in multi-temporal images, the post-classification approach usually suffers from an accumulation of misclassification errors. In order to solve this problem, previous studies have separated the change and non-change candidates with change vector analysis, and they have only updated the classes of the changed pixels with the post-classification; however, this approach with thresholding loses the continuous change intensity information, where larger values indicate higher probability to be changed. Therefore, in this paper, a new post-classification method with iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) and Bayesian soft fusion is proposed to obtain reliable and accurate change detection maps. The proposed method consists of three main steps: 1) independent classification is implemented to obtain the class probability for each image; 2) the ISFA algorithm is used to obtain the continuous change probability map of multi-temporal images, where the value of each pixel indicates the probability to be changed; and 3) based on Bayesian theory, the a posteriori probabilities for the class combinations of coupled pixels are calmlated to integrate the class probability with the change probability, which is named as Bayesian soft fusion. The class combination with the maximum a posteriori probability is then determined as the change detection result. In addition, a class probability filter is proposed to avoid the false alarms caused by the spectral variation within the same class. Two experiments with multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images indicated that the proposed method achieves a clearly higher change detection accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method based on Bayesian theory and ISFA was also verified to have the ability to improve the change detection rate and reduce the false alarms at the same time. Given its effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could be widely applied in land-use/land-cover change detection and monitoring at a large scale. 

    利用多时相遥感图像进行后分类是目前最流行的变化检测方法之一，在实际应用中提供了详细的“从-到”变化信息。然而，由于后分类方法忽略了多时间图像中对应像素之间的时间相关性，往往会导致分类错误的积累。为了解决这一问题，以往的研究都是通过变化向量分析将变化候选项与非变化候选项进行分离，只对变化后的像素类进行后分类更新;然而，这种阈值化方法丢失了连续变化强度信息，其中值越大表示发生变化的可能性越大。为此，本文提出了一种迭代慢特征分析(ISFA)与贝叶斯软融合的后分类方法，以获得可靠、准确的变化检测图。该方法由三个主要步骤组成:1)实现独立分类，得到每幅图像的类概率;2)采用ISFA算法得到多时间图像的连续变化概率图，其中每个像素的值表示发生变化的概率;3)基于贝叶斯理论，计算耦合像素类组合的后验概率，将类概率与变化概率进行融合，称为贝叶斯软融合。然后确定具有最大后验概率的类组合作为变化检测结果。此外，提出了一种类概率滤波器，以避免由于类内频谱变化引起的虚警。利用多时相Landsat专题地图(TM)图像进行的两次实验表明，与现有的方法相比，该方法具有更高的变化检测精度。同时验证了基于贝叶斯理论和ISFA的方法具有提高变化检出率和减少误报的能力。由于该方法的有效性和灵活性，可广泛应用于土地利用/土地覆盖变化的大规模检测和监测。

    Scene change detection between multitemporal image scenes can be used to interpret the variation of regional land use, and has significant potential in the application of urban development monitoring at the semantic level. The traditional methods directly comparing the independent semantic classes neglect the temporal correlation, and thus suffer from accumulated classification errors. In this paper, we propose a novel scene change detection method via kernel slow feature analysis (KSFA) and postclassification fusion, which integrates independent scene classification with scene change detection to accurately determine scene changes and identify the "from-to" transition type. After representation with the bag-of-visual-words model, KSFA is proposed to extract the nonlinear temporally invariant features, to better measure the change probability between corresponding multitemporal image scenes. Two postclassification fusion methods, which are based on Bayesian theory and predefined rules, respectively, are then employed to identify the optimal coupled class combinations of multitemporal scene pairs. Furthermore, in addition to identifying semantic changes, the proposed method can also improve the performance of scene classification, since the unchanged scenes are more likely to belong to the same class. Two experiments with high- resolution remote sensing image scene data sets confirm that the proposed method can increase the accuracy of scene change detection, scene transition identification, and scene classification.

    多时相图像场景之间的场景变化检测可以用来解释区域土地利用的变化，在语义层面上应用城市发展监测具有重要的潜力。传统的直接比较独立语义类的方法忽略了时间相关性，从而积累了分类错误。本文提出了一种新的基于核慢特征分析(KSFA)和后分类融合的场景变化检测方法，将独立的场景分类与场景变化检测相结合，准确判断场景变化，识别“由-到”转换类型。在用视觉词袋模型表示后，提出KSFA提取非线性时不变特征，以更好地度量对应的多时间图像场景之间的变化概率。然后分别采用基于贝叶斯理论和预定义规则的后分类融合方法来识别多时间场景对的最优耦合类组合。此外，除了识别语义变化外，该方法还可以提高场景分类的性能，因为未变化的场景更有可能属于同一类。通过对高分辨率遥感影像场景数据集的两次实验验证，该方法能够提高场景变化检测、场景过渡识别和场景分类的精度。

    Due to the existence of mixed pixels in a remote sensed image, traditional change detection (CD) methods at "fullpixel level" are often unable to provide detailed changed information effectively. A subpixel change detection (SCD) technique can deal with this issue with two steps: soft classification is applied to derive proportional differences from coarse multitemporal images, and then a sharpened thematic map with fine spatial resolution is generated based on subpixel mapping. However, changes in endmember combination within pixels are ignored, which can result in flawed differences and degraded accuracy of SCD. The aim of this letter is to present a new SCD algorithm using variability of endmembers (SCD_VE), where a simple but effective model is proposed to take into consideration the real change of endmember combination. In order to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm, experiment is conducted on simulated images. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SCD_VE offers better performance than traditional SCD methods in providing more detailed CD map.

    由于遥感图像中存在混合像素，传统的“全像素级”变化检测(CD)方法往往无法有效地提供详细的变化信息。亚像素变化检测(SCD)技术可以通过两个步骤来解决这一问题:首先采用软分类方法从粗糙的多时间图像中提取比例差异，然后在亚像素映射的基础上生成具有精细空间分辨率的锐化专题地图。然而，由于忽略了像素内endmember组合的变化，会导致SCD存在缺陷，精度下降。本文的目的是提出一种利用端元变异性的SCD算法，提出了一种考虑端元组合实际变化的简单而有效的模型。为了评价新算法的性能，对仿真图像进行了实验。实验结果表明，与传统的SCD方法相比，本文提出的SCD_VE在提供更详细的CD图方面具有更好的性能。

40.	Wu, K., et al. (2017). "**Supervised Sub-Pixel Mapping for Change Detection from Remotely Sensed Images with Different Resolutions**." Remote Sensing 9(3).

    Due to the relatively low temporal resolutions of high spatial resolution (HR) remotely sensed images, land-cover change detection (LCCD) may have to use multi-temporal images with different resolutions. The low spatial resolution (LR) images often have high temporal repetition rates, but they contain a large number of mixed pixels, which may seriously limit their capability in change detection. Soft classification (SC) can produce the proportional fractions of land-covers, on which sub-pixel mapping (SPM) can construct fine resolution land-cover maps to reduce the low-spatial- resolution-problem to some extent. Thus, in this paper, sub-pixel land-cover change detection with the use of different resolution images (SLCCD_DR) is addressed based on SC and SPM. Previously, endmember combinations within pixels are ignored in the LR image, which may result in flawed fractional differences. Meanwhile, the information of a known HR land-cover map is insignificantly treated in the SPM models, which leads to a reluctant SLCCD_DR result. In order to overcome these issues, a novel approach based on a back propagation neural network (BPNN) with different resolution images (BPNN_DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, endmember variability per pixel is considered during the SC process to ensure the high accuracy of the derived proportional fractional difference image. After that, the BPNN-based SPM model is constructed by a complete supervised framework. It takes full advantage of the prior known HR image, whether it predates or postdates the LR image, to train the BPNN, so that a sub-pixel change detection map is generated effectively. The proposed BPNN_DR is compared with four state-of-the-art methods at different scale factors. The experimental results using both synthetic data and real images demonstrated that it can outperform with a more detailed change detection map being produced.

    
    由于高空间分辨率遥感图像的时间分辨率相对较低，土地覆盖变化检测(LCCD)可能需要使用不同分辨率的多时间图像。低空间分辨率(LR)图像往往具有较高的时间重复率，但同时含有大量混合像素，严重限制了其变化检测能力。软分类(SC)可以生成土地覆盖的比例分数，亚像素映射(SPM)可以在此基础上构建精细分辨率的土地覆盖图，在一定程度上减少了低空间分辨率问题。因此，本文提出了基于SC和SPM的不同分辨率图像(SLCCD_DR)亚像素土地覆盖变化检测方法。以前，LR图像中忽略像素内的endmember组合，这可能会导致有缺陷的分数差异。同时，SPM模型对已知的HR土地覆被图信息处理不显著，导致SLCCD_DR结果不理想。为了克服这些问题，提出了一种基于不同分辨率图像的反向传播神经网络(BPNN)。首先，在SC过程中考虑每个像素的最终成员变异性，以保证得到的比例分数差分图像的高精度。在此基础上，利用完整的监督框架构造了基于bpnnn的SPM模型。它充分利用已有的已知HR图像，无论是早于LR图像还是晚于LR图像，训练BPNN，从而有效地生成亚像素变化检测图。在不同的尺度因子下，将所提出的BPNN_DR方法与四种最先进的方法进行了比较。实验结果表明，该方法在生成更详细的变化检测图的情况下，具有更好的性能。

    Extracting subpixel land-cover change detection (SLCCD) information is important when multitemporal remotely sensed images with different resolutions are available. The general steps are as follows. First, soft classification is applied to a low-resolution (LR) image to generate the proportion of each class. Second, the proportion differences are produced by the use of another high- resolution (HR) image and used as the input of subpixel mapping. Finally, a subpixel sharpened difference map can be generated. However, the prior HR land-cover map is only used to compare with the enhanced map of LR image for change detection, which leads to a nonideal SLCCD result. In this letter, we present a new approach based on a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) with a HR map (BPNN_HRM), in which a supervised model is introduced into SLCCD for the first time. The known information of the HR land-cover map is adequately employed to train the BPNN, whether it predates or postdates the LR image, so that a subpixel change detection map can be effectively generated. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it was compared with four state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results confirm that the BPNN_HRM method outperforms the other traditional methods in providing a more detailed map for change detection.

    提取不同分辨率的多时相遥感图像的亚像素地表覆盖变化检测(SLCCD)信息具有重要意义。一般步骤如下。首先，对低分辨率(LR)图像进行软分类，生成每个类的比例。其次，利用另一幅高分辨率(HR)图像作为亚像素映射的输入，产生比例差。最后，生成亚像素锐化差分图。然而，现有的HR土地覆被图仅用于与LR图像的增强图进行对比进行变化检测，导致SLCCD结果不理想。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于带HR map (BPNN_HRM)的反向传播神经网络(BPNN)的新方法，该方法首次将监督模型引入SLCCD。充分利用HR土地覆被图的已知信息对bp神经网络进行训练，无论bp神经网络是早于LR图像还是晚于LR图像，从而有效生成亚像素变化检测图。为了评价该算法的性能，将其与四种最先进的算法进行了比较。实验结果表明，BPNN_HRM方法在提供更详细的变化检测地图方面优于其他传统方法。

    This paper presents a cosegmentation-based method for building change detection from multitemporal high-resolution (HR) remotely sensed images, providing a new solution to object- based change detection (OBCD). First, the magnitude of a difference image is calculated to represent the change feature. Next, cosegmentation is performed via graph-based energy minimization by combining the change feature with image features at each phase, directly resulting in foreground as multitemporal changed objects and background as unchanged area. Finally, the spatial correspondence between changed objects is established through overlay analysis. Cosegmentation provides a separate and associated, rather than a separate and independent, multitemporal image segmentation method for OBCD, which has two advantages: 1) both the image and change features are used to produce foreground segments as changed objects, which can take full advantage of multitemporal information and produce two spatially corresponded change detection maps by the association of the change feature, having the ability to reveal the thematic, geometric, and numeric changes of objects and 2) the background in the cosegmentation result represents the unchanged area, which naturally avoids the problem of matching inconsistent unchanged objects caused by the separate and independent multitemporal segmentation strategy. Experimental results on five HR datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the comparisons with the state-of-the- art OBCD methods further show its superiority.

43.	Gang Yang, Heng-Chao Li, Chi Liu:**Unsupervised change detection of remote sensing images using superpixel segmentation and variational Gaussian mixture model**. MultiTemp 2017: 1-4

    In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised change detection approach for multitemporal remote sensing (RS) images based on superpixel segmentation and variational Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Firstly, the generated difference image is segmented into multiple superpixels using entropy rate superpixel (ERS) segmentation, which allows for the spatial contextual information to be taken into account in change detection. As such, we utilize the GMM to model the distribution of these superpixels, and assign each superpixel to one component using variational inference (VI)algorithm. Subsequently, according to mean square error (MSE) criterion, the resulting clusters are further grouped into two classes, respectively representing the changed class and unchanged class. As a consequence, we can achieve the change mask (CM) by assigning the superpixels (and its pixels) to the corresponding classes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with two real multitemporal RS images.

    提出了一种基于超像素分割和变分高斯混合模型(GMM)的遥感图像无监督变化检测方法。首先，利用熵率超像素(ERS)分割方法将生成的差分图像分割成多个超像素，在变化检测中考虑空间上下文信息。因此，我们利用GMM对这些超像素的分布进行建模，并使用变分推理(VI)算法将每个超像素分配给一个组件。然后，根据均方误差(MSE)准则，将得到的聚类进一步分组为两个类，分别表示已变化的类和未变化的类。因此，我们可以通过将超像素(及其像素)分配给相应的类来实现变化图(CM)。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。

    Change detection has been widely used in remote sensing, such as for disaster assessment and urban expansion detection. Although it is convenient to use unsupervised methods to detect changes from multi-temporal images, the results could be further improved. In supervised methods, heavy data labelling tasks are needed, and the sample annotation process with real categories is tedious and costly. To relieve the burden of labelling and to obtain satisfactory results, we propose an interactive change detection framework based on active learning and Markov random field (MRF). More specifically, a limited number of representative objects are found in an unsupervised way at the beginning. Then, the very limited samples are labelled as change or no change to train a simple binary classification model, i.e., a Gaussian process model. By using this model, we then select and label the most informative samples by the easiest sample selection strategy to update the former weak classification model until the detection results do not change notably. Finally, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) change detection is efficiently computed via the min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm. The time consuming and laborious manual labelling process can be reduced substantially, and a desirable detection result can be obtained. The experiments on several WorldView-2 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    变化检测在遥感中得到了广泛的应用，如灾害评估和城市扩张检测等。虽然使用无监督的方法检测多时间图像的变化是很方便的，但其结果还可以进一步提高。在有监督的方法中，需要大量的数据标记任务，并且带有真实类别的示例注释过程是冗长和昂贵的。为了减轻标记的负担并获得满意的结果，我们提出了一种基于主动学习和马尔可夫随机场(MRF)的交互式变化检测框架。更具体地说，在开始时以一种无监督的方式找到有限数量的代表性对象。然后，将非常有限的样本标记为change或no change来训练一个简单的二分类模型，即，高斯过程模型。利用该模型，用最简单的样本选择策略选择并标注信息量最大的样本，对原有的弱分类模型进行更新，直到检测结果没有明显变化。最后，通过基于最小割的整数优化算法，有效地计算了最大后验(MAP)变化检测。大大减少了手工贴标的时间和费力，获得了理想的检测结果。通过对WorldView-2图像的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

    In this letter, we propose a novel supervised change detection method based on a deep siamese convolutional network for optical aerial images. We train a siamese convolutional network using the weighted contrastive loss. The novelty of the method is that the siamese network is learned to extract features directly from the image pairs. Compared with hand-crafted features used by the conventional change detection method, the extracted features are more abstract and robust. Furthermore, because of the advantage of the weighted contrastive loss function, the features have a unique property: the feature vectors of the changed pixel pair are far away from each other, while the ones of the unchanged pixel pair are close. Therefore, we use the distance of the feature vectors to detect changes between the image pair. Simple threshold segmentation on the distance map can even obtain good performance. For improvement, we use a k-nearest neighbor approach to update the initial result. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces results comparable, even better, with the two state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-measure.

    本文提出了一种基于深度Siamese卷积网络的光学航空图像监督变化检测方法。利用加权对比损失训练了一个Siamese卷积网络。该方法的新颖之处在于，通过学习Siamese网络直接从图像对中提取特征。与传统的手工特征检测方法相比，所提取的特征更加抽象、鲁棒。此外，由于加权对比损失函数的优点，特征具有一个独特的性质:变化的像素对的特征向量距离较远，而不变的像素对的特征向量距离较近。因此，我们使用特征向量的距离来检测图像对之间的变化。简单的阈值分割在距离图上甚至可以获得良好的性能。为了改进，我们使用k近邻方法来更新初始结果。实验结果表明，该方法在f值测量方面与两种最先进的方法具有可比性，甚至更好。

    The change detection method based on multi-temporal object was implemented by chi-square test and Gaussian distribution iteration to find the changed object in the past. However, trapped in the sample data does not obey the Gaussian distribution, the detection effect is not ideal. In order to fix this problem, a method based on law of cosines with box-whisker plot is proposed. First, the feature space of different time images is constructed. Then, the law of cosines is used to calculate the change index of every object. The changed objects are identified through analyzing the change index by the box-whisker plot at last. High-resolution remote sensing images of GF-1 are used as the experimental data. The experimental results show that the correct detection accuracy and omissions rate accuracy are much better than the results of the traditional multi-temporal object based change detection.

    This study proposes the use of a level set incorporated with an improved Markov random field (MRF) model in unsupervised change detection for satellite images. MRF provides a means of modelling the spatial contextual information in the level set, and an edge indicator function is introduced into the MRF model to control the contribution of local information in the boundary areas to change detection. On the basis of the improved MRF model, local label relationships and edge information are considered in the level set energy functional to conduct a novel local term and attract the contours into desired objects. By merging the novel energy term, the proposed approach not only reduces noise but also obtains accurate outlines of the changed regions. Experimental results obtained with Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and SPOT 5 data sets confirm the superiority of the proposed model when compared with state-of-the-art change detection methods.

    This letter presents a novel method for unsupervised change detection (CD) from remote sensing images using level set evolution with local uncertainty constraints (LSELUC). Uncertainty analysis of pixel labels was implemented as prior information to guide the evolution of level curves. Then, local uncertainty and gradient information of level curves were incorporated into the level set energy function to construct local energy constraints. The proposed method can reduce noise, while preserving details in change regions. Furthermore, an advanced regularization strategy of the level set function was adopted to improve the computational efficiency. The performance of the proposed method was validated on two remote sensing data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can produce satisfactory CD results.

    High-resolution remote sensing (HR) images provide geometric details of land surface, allowing detailed comparison of geographic objects for change detection. Object-based change detection (OBCD) has become the principle approach to detect changes from HR images. Within OBCD, the separate segmentation strategy has the potential of revealing specific object-to-object changes by providing distinct multi-temporal segments for comparison. Three separate segmentation strategies, named SIISeg, SAISeg, and SAOSeg, are compared to show the importance of imbedding association cues in separate segmentation procedure for successive spatial correspondence establishment to reveal the geometric changes. Buildings in urban area are used as examples to show the change detection results and a pair of aerial images is used in the experiment to show the comparison result.

    High-resolution (HR) remote sensing images present geometric details of land surface. Object-based change detection (OBCD) provides an effective solution to reveal detailed changes of geographic objects in HR images. In OBCD, the separate segmentation strategy holds the potential of revealing specific object-to-object changes, but it is difficult to establish spatial correspondence between distinct multi-temporal segments. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed to first detect multi- temporal changed objects based on separate segmentations and then to establish spatial correspondence between changed objects at different phases. Three separate segmentation strategies, named as SIISeg, SAISeg, and SAOSeg, are compared to indicate the importance of associating separate segmentation procedures for successive spatial correspondence establishment. The experiments of detecting building changes in urban area are performed to demonstrate the success, benefits, and potentials of establishing spatial correspondence for object-to-object change detection.

    With the application requirement, the technique for change detection based on heterogeneous remote sensing images is paid more attention. However, detecting changes between two heterogeneous images is challenging as they cannot be compared in low-dimensional space. In this paper, we construct an approximately symmetric deep neural network with two sides containing the same number of coupled layers to transform the two images into the same feature space. The two images are connected with the two sides and transformed into the same feature space, in which their features are more discriminative and the difference image can be generated by comparing paired features pixel by pixel. The network is first built by stacked restricted Boltzmann machines, and then, the parameters are updated in a special way based on clustering. The special way, motivated by that two heterogeneous images share the same reality in unchanged areas and retain respective properties in changed areas, shrinks the distance between paired features transformed from unchanged positions, and enlarges the distance between paired features extracted from changed positions. It is achieved through introducing two types of labels and updating parameters by adaptively changed learning rate. This is different from the existing methods based on deep learning that just do operations on positions predicted to be unchanged and extract only one type of labels. The whole process is completely unsupervised without any priori knowledge. Besides, the method can also be applied to homogeneous images. We test our method on heterogeneous images and homogeneous images. The proposed method achieves quite high accuracy.

    随着应用的需要，基于异构遥感图像的变化检测技术越来越受到重视。然而，由于无法在低维空间中进行比较，检测两幅异构图像之间的变化是一项具有挑战性的工作。本文构造了一个两边含有相同耦合层数的近似对称深神经网络，将两幅图像转换成相同的特征空间。将两幅图像连接到图像的两侧，并将其转化为相同的特征空间，使两幅图像的特征具有更强的识别力，通过逐像素比较成对的特征可以生成不同的图像。该网络首先由多台受限的玻尔兹曼机组成，然后基于聚类对参数进行特殊的更新。这种特殊的方法，是由两幅异质图像在不变区域共享相同的现实，在变化区域保留各自的属性，缩小了从不变位置变换成对特征之间的距离，扩大了从变化位置提取成对特征之间的距离。通过引入两种类型的标签，并通过自适应变化学习率来更新参数来实现。这与现有的基于深度学习的方法不同，现有方法只对预测不变的位置进行操作，只提取一种类型的标签。整个过程完全没有监督，没有任何先验知识。此外，该方法还可以应用于均匀图像。我们在非均匀图像和均匀图像上测试了我们的方法。该方法具有较高的精度。

    One main problem of the spectral decomposition-based change detection method is the lack of efficient automatic techniques for developing the difference image. Traditional techniques generally assume that gray-level values in a difference image are independent and multitemporal images are co-registered/rectified perfectly without error. However, such assumptions are often violated because of the inevitable image misregistration and the interference of correlations between spectral bands. This study proposes an automated method based on the object-based multivariate alteration detection/maximum autocorrelation factor approach and the Gaussian mixture model-expectation maximization algorithm to obtain unsupervised difference images. This procedure is applied to bi- temporal (2005 and 2006) SPOT-HRV images at Panyu District Ponds, China. Results show that the proposed method successfully excludes the correlations of spectral bands and the influence of misregistration, as evidenced by a higher accuracy (up to 93.6 percent). These unique technical characteristics make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes.

    基于谱分解的变化检测方法存在的一个主要问题是缺乏有效的差分图像自动生成技术。传统的图像处理技术通常假设不同图像的灰度值是独立的，多时间图像的共配/校正是完全没有误差的。然而，由于不可避免的图像配准错误和谱带间相关性的干扰，这些假设常常被违反。本文提出了一种基于目标的多变量变化检测/最大自相关因子法和高斯混合模型期望最大化算法的无监督差分图像自动获取方法。将该方法应用于番禺区池塘的双时间点(2005年和2006年)hrv图像。结果表明，该方法成功地排除了谱带相关性和配准误差的影响，具有较高的精度(高达93.6%)。这些独特的技术特性使得该分析框架适合于检测变化。

    Change vector analysis (CVA) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) are widely used for change detection in multitemporal multispectral images. CVA and SAM describe the difference from the perspective of vector magnitude and spectral angle, respectively. It has been proved that three change categories may occur in a changed pixel; however, CVA or SAM alone can only detect two of the three change categories properly. Hence, we propose a novel approach integrating the advantages of them to acquire a better change map. This approach, based on discrete wavelet transform (ABDWT, i.e. approach based on discrete wavelet transform), obtains two difference images by using CVA and SAM, and then yields a novel difference image by fusing them in the coefficients domains of discrete wavelet transform. Experimental results from a simulated and two real data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the first real data set, the proposed approach can identify 14,916 changed pixels while the best result of other methods is 14,806. In the second real data set, the proposed approach detects 3203 changed pixels, while the maximum of other methods is 3189.

    变化矢量分析(CVA)和光谱角映射(SAM)在多时间多光谱图像的变化检测中得到了广泛的应用。CVA和SAM分别从矢量大小和光谱角度描述了两者的差异。研究表明，在一个变化的像素中可能发生三种变化类别;然而，仅CVA或SAM就只能正确地检测这三种变化类别中的两种。因此，我们提出了一种新的方法来综合它们的优点来获得更好的变化图。该方法基于离散小波变换(ABDWT，即基于离散小波变换的方法)，利用CVA和SAM分别得到两幅差分图像，然后将它们融合到离散小波变换的系数域中，得到一幅新的差分图像。仿真和两个实际数据集的实验结果验证了该方法的有效性。在第一个真实数据集中，该方法可以识别14,916个变化的像素，其他方法的最佳结果为14,806。在第二个真实数据集中，该方法检测到3203个变化的像素，其他方法的最大值为3189。
