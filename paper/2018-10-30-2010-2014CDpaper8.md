   In this paper, the unsupervised change-detection problem in remote sensing images is formulated as a segmentation issue where the discrimination between changed and unchanged classes in the difference image is achieved by defining a proper energy functional. The minimization of this functional is carried out by means of a level set method which iteratively seeks to find a global optimal contour splitting the image into two mutually exclusive regions associated with changed and unchanged classes, respectively. In order to increase the robustness of the method to noise and to the choice of the initial contour, a multiresolution implementation, which performs an analysis of the difference image at different resolution levels, is proposed. The experimental results obtained on three different multitemporal remote sensing images acquired by low- as well as high-spatial- resolution optical remote sensing sensors suggest a clear superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art change-detection methods.

   本文将遥感图像中的无监督变化检测问题定义为一个分割问题，通过定义一个合适的能量泛函来实现对不同图像中变化类和未变化类的区分。该函数的最小化是通过水平集方法实现的，该方法迭代地寻找全局最优轮廓，并将图像分割为两个相互排斥的区域，分别与已更改的类和未更改的类相关联。为了提高该方法对噪声的鲁棒性和对初始轮廓选择的鲁棒性，提出了一种对不同分辨率下的不同图像进行分析的多分辨率实现。实验结果表明，该方法与现有的变化检测方法相比，具有明显的优越性。

   The amount of scientific literature on (Geographic) Object-based Image Analysis GEOBIA has been and still is sharply increasing. These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied tohigh resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the 'per-pixel paradigm' and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm. 

   关于(地理)基于对象的图像分析GEOBIA的科学文献数量已经并仍在急剧增加。这些图像分析方法在早期的图像分割研究中已有先例，并在分类和特征提取方法中使用了类似gis的空间分析方法。本文探讨了这些发展及其意义，并提出这是否是遥感与地理信息科学(GIScience)的新范式。我们首先讨论了当前流行的逐像素方法的几个限制高分辨率图像。然后，我们探讨了库恩(1962)提出的范式概念，并根据这一定义讨论了GEOBIA是否可以被视为范式。我们明确了GEOBIA的核心概念，包括对象的角色、本体和尺度的多样性，并讨论了这些概念的发展如何支持遥感中的重要方法，如变化检测和精度评估。分析了“每像素范式”和GEOBIA之间不同理论基础的影响，以及从像素到对象到地理智能这条道路上的一些挑战。基于库恩定义的几个范式指标，并基于对同行评审的科学文献的分析，我们得出结论，GEOBIA是一个新的、不断发展的范式

   The updating of geodatabases (GDB) in urban environments is a difficult and expensive task. It may be facilitated by an automatic change detection method. Several methods have been developed for medium and low spatial resolution images. This study proposes a new method for change detection of buildings in urban environments from very high spatial resolution images (VHSR) and using existing digital cartographic data. The proposed methodology is composed of several stages. The existing knowledge on the buildings and the other urban objects are first modelled and saved in a knowledge base. Some change detection rules are defined at this stage. Then, the image is segmented. The parameters of segmentation are computed thanks to the integration between the image and the geodatabase. Thereafter, the segmented image is analyzed using the knowledge base to localize the segments where the change of building is likely to occur. The change detection rules are then applied on these segments to identify the segments that represent the changes of buildings. These changes represent the updates of buildings to be added to the geodatabase. The data used in this research concern the city of Sherbrooke (Quebec, Canada) and the city of Rabat (Morocco). For Sherbrooke, we used an Ikonos image acquired in October 2006 and a GDB at the scale of 1:20,000. For Rabat, a QuickBird image acquired in August 2006 has been used with a GDB at the scale of 1:10,000. The rate of good detection is 90%. The proposed method presents some limitations on the detection of the exact contours of the buildings. It could be improved by including a shape post-analysis of detected buildings. The proposed method could be integrated into a cartographic update process or as a method for the quality assessment of a geodatabase. It could be also be used to identify illegal building work or to monitor urban growth. 

   在城市环境中更新地理数据库(GDB)是一项困难而昂贵的任务。它可以通过自动变化检测方法来实现。对于中、低空间分辨率的图像，已经发展了多种方法。本文提出了一种利用高空间分辨率图像(VHSR)和现有的数字制图数据对城市环境中建筑物变化进行检测的新方法。所提议的方法包括几个阶段。首先对建筑物和其他城市对象的现有知识进行建模，并保存在知识库中。在此阶段定义了一些变化检测规则。然后，对图像进行分割。利用图像与地理数据库的结合，计算了分割参数。然后利用知识库对分割后的图像进行分析，对可能发生建筑物变化的区域进行局部化。然后将变化检测规则应用到这些段上，以识别代表建筑物变化的段。这些更改表示要添加到地理数据库的建筑物的更新。本研究使用的数据涉及舍布鲁克市(加拿大魁北克)和拉巴特市(摩洛哥)。对于Sherbrooke，我们使用了2006年10月获得的Ikonos图像和1:20 000的GDB。对于拉巴特来说，2006年8月获得的QuickBird图像已经与GDB一起使用，比例为1:10 000。良好的检出率为90%。该方法对建筑物轮廓线的精确检测存在一定的局限性。它可以通过包括检测到的建筑物的形状后分析来改进。该方法可以集成到地图更新过程中，也可以作为地理数据库质量评估的一种方法。它也可以用来确定非法建筑工作或监测城市增长。

   Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (D-Man), Euclidean (D-E) and Mahalanobis (D-Mah) distance measures, to correlation (D-CC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; D-PCA) and Fourier based (D-FFT,D- xi, D-Fk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) D-Man, D-E, D-PCA. D- Fk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) D-Mah accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) D-CC measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based D-FFT and D-xi show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the importance of (i)understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification.

   遥感图像或导出的植被指数和生物物理产品的时间序列已被证明对描述土地生态系统动态特别有用。基于时间轨迹分析的生态系统动态变化特征、分类和检测方法已经发展起来。虽然时间序列相似性测度在这些方法中起着重要作用，但缺乏对相似性测度的定量比较。本研究的目的是对不同时间序列和生态系统特征(振幅、时序和噪声效应)的函数相似性测度进行综述和定量比较。为此，我们评估了常用的相似性度量(D)的性能，从Manhattan (D- man)、Euclidean (D- e)和Mahalanobis (D- mah)距离度量，到correlation (D- cc)、Principal Component Analysis (PCA);与基于傅里叶变换的(D- fft,D- xi, D- fk)相似。定量比较包括一系列基于全局MODIS归一化植被指数(NDVI)、增强植被指数(EVI)和叶面积指数(LAI)数据子集的蒙特卡罗模拟。仿真结果揭示了四组具有不同灵敏度的时间序列相似性度量方法:(i) D-Man、D-E、D-PCA。D- Fk量化了时间序列值的差异，(ii) D- mah解释了时间相关性和方差的非平稳性，(iii) D- cc测量了时间相关性，(iv)基于傅里叶变换的D- fft和D-xi基于所选择的傅里叶分量显示了它们的特定灵敏度。差分测量对振幅效应的灵敏度相对较高，而相关测量对时序和噪声的变化高度敏感。最后，基于傅里叶变换的测量方法在很大程度上依赖于信噪比以及振幅和相位优势之间的平衡。每个D敏感性的异质性强调(i)在应用任何变化检测方法分类之前理解时间序列特征，以及(ii)定义希望识别/解释的可变性的重要性。这需要了解生态系统动力学和与生态系统时间序列的基线、振幅、时序、噪声和变异性相关的时间序列特征。的定量比较,这也说明了不同敏感性的归一化植被指数D,追杀和赖数据与具体的时序特征每个数据集。此外,噪声的影响和内部,组内的变化中演示了一个案例研究是基于土地覆盖分类。

   The 2009-2010 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Data Fusion Technical Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society was focused on the detection of flooded areas using multi- temporal and multi-modal images. Both high spatial resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar data were provided. The goal was not only to identify the best algorithms (in terms of accuracy), but also to investigate the further improvement derived from decision fusion. This paper presents the four awarded algorithms and the conclusions of the contest, investigating both supervised and unsupervised methods and the use of multi-modal data for flood detection. Interestingly, a simple unsupervised change detection method provided similar accuracy as supervised approaches, and a digital elevation model-based predictive method yielded a comparable projected change detection map without using post-event data.

   由IEEE地球科学与遥感学会数据融合技术委员会主办的2009-2010年数据融合竞赛，重点是利用多时间和多模态图像检测洪水地区。提供了高空间分辨率的光学和合成孔径雷达数据。我们的目标不仅是确定最佳算法(就精确度而言)，而且还要研究从决策融合中得到的进一步改进。本文介绍了四种获奖算法和比赛结果，研究了监督和非监督方法以及多模态数据在洪水检测中的应用。有趣的是，一种简单的无监督变化检测方法提供了与监督方法类似的准确性，而一种基于数字高程模型的预测方法在不使用事件后数据的情况下生成了一幅类似的投影变化检测地图。

   In this paper we study an effective solution to deal with supervised change detection in very high geometrical resolution (VHR) images. High within-class variance as well as low between-class variance that characterize this kind of imagery make the detection and classification of ground cover transitions a difficult task. In order to achieve high detection accuracy, we propose the inclusion of spatial and contextual information issued from local textural statistics and mathematical morphology. To perform change detection, two architectures, initially developed for medium resolution images, are adapted for VHR: Direct Multi-date Classification and Difference Image Analysis. To cope with the high intra-class variability, we adopted a nonlinear classifier: the Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed approaches are successfully evaluated on two series of pansharpened QuickBird images.

   本文研究了一种有效的方法来处理高几何分辨率(VHR)图像中的监督变化检测问题。高类内方差和低类间方差是该类图像的特征，这使得地面覆盖过渡的检测和分类成为一项艰巨的任务。为了达到较高的检测精度，我们提出了包含从局部纹理统计和数学形态学发出的空间和上下文信息。为了实现变化检测，VHR采用了两种体系结构:直接多数据分类和差分图像分析，这两种体系结构最初是为中分辨率图像开发的。为了解决高类内变异性，我们采用了一种非线性分类器:支持向量机(SVM)。该方法已成功地应用于两组经过pansharpened的QuickBird图像上。


7.	Zhu, Z. and C. E. Woodcock (2014). "**Continuous change detection and classification of land cover using all available Landsat data**." Remote Sensing of Environment 144: 152-171.

   A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two- step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519)Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250 pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250 pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98% and user's accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90%. 

   提出了一种利用现有陆地卫星数据进行土地覆盖连续变化检测与分类的新算法。它能够随着新图像的采集而不断检测多种土地覆被变化，并在给定时间内提供土地覆被图。采用两步云、云阴影和雪掩蔽算法消除“噪声”观测。由季节性、趋势和断裂组成的时间序列模型估计表面反射率和亮度温度。利用新获得的观测数据动态更新时间序列模型。由于不同地表覆盖变化对光谱响应的差异，CCDC算法使用了来自所有7个Landsat波段的阈值。当观测到的和预测到的图像之间的差异连续三次超过阈值时，一个像素被识别为地表变化。变化检测后进行土地覆被分类。将时间序列模型的系数和模型估计的均方根误差(RMSE)作为随机森林分类器(RFC)的输入。我们将CCDC算法应用于新英格兰的一个陆地卫星场景(WRS路径12和第31行)。使用了1982年至2011年间获得的所有可用(总共519张)陆地卫星图像。采用随机分层样本设计对变化检测精度进行评估，在持续土地覆盖区域内选取250个像素，在CCDC算法确定的变化区域内选取250个像素。精度评估表明，CCDC结果对地表变化的检测精度较高，在空间域和时间域的精度分别为80%和86%，其中生产者的准确率为98%，用户的准确率为86%。土地覆被参考资料是评估土地覆被分类准确性的依据。CCDC算法生成的16类土地覆被图总体精度为90%。

8.	Zhu, Z., et al. (2012). "**Continuous monitoring of forest disturbance using all available Landsat imagery**." Remote Sensing of Environment 122: 75-91.

   A new change detection algorithm for continuous monitoring of forest disturbance at high temporal frequency is developed. Using all available Landsat 7 images in two years, time series models consisting of sines and cosines are estimated for each pixel for each spectral band. Dropping the coefficients that capture inter-annual change, time series models can predict surface reflectance for pixels at any location and any date assuming persistence of land cover. The Continuous Monitoring of Forest Disturbance Algorithm (CMFDA) flags forest disturbance by differencing the predicted and observed Landsat images. Two algorithms (single-date and multi-date differencing) were tested for detecting forest disturbance at a Savannah River site. The map derived from the multi-date differencing algorithm was chosen as the final CMFDA result, due to its higher spatial and temporal accuracies. It determines a disturbance pixel by the number of times "change" is observed consecutively. Pixels showing "change" for one or two times are flagged as "probable change". If the pixel is flagged for the third time, the pixel is determined to have changed. The accuracy assessment shows that CMFDA results were accurate for detecting forest disturbance, with both produce'r's and user's accuracies higher than 95% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of approximately 94%.

   提出了一种新的高时间频率森林扰动连续监测的变化检测算法。利用两年内所有可用的landsat7图像，对每个光谱波段的每个像素估计由正弦和余弦组成的时间序列模型。时间序列模型剔除了捕捉年际变化的系数，在假定土地覆盖持续存在的前提下，可以预测任意位置和任意日期的像素的地表反射率。森林干扰连续监测算法(CMFDA)通过对预测和观测到的陆地卫星图像进行区分，来识别森林干扰。采用单日期差分和多日期差分两种方法对萨凡纳河流域森林扰动进行了检测。基于多日期差分算法得到的地图由于具有较高的时空精度，最终选择了CMFDA的结果。它通过连续观察“变化”的次数来确定扰动像素。显示“更改”一两次的像素被标记为“可能更改”。如果第三次标记该像素，则确定该像素已更改。精度评估表明，CMFDA结果对森林扰动的检测是准确的，其在空间域和时间域的准确率均高于95%，用户的准确率约为94%。
