    The goal of this paper is to investigate the maximum level of semantic resolution that can be achieved in an automated land use change detection process based on mono-temporal, multi-spectral, high-resolution aerial image data. For this purpose, we perform a step-wise refinement of the land use classes that follows the hierarchical structure of most object catalogues for land use databases. The investigation is based on our previous work for the simultaneous contextual classification of aerial imagery to determine land cover and land use. Land cover is determined at the level of small image segments. Land use classification is applied to objects from the geospatial database. Experiments are carried out on two test areas with different characteristics and are intended to evaluate the step-wise refinement of the land use classes empirically. The experiments show that a semantic resolution of ten classes still delivers acceptable results, where the accuracy of the results depends on the characteristics of the test areas used. Furthermore, we confirm that the incorporation of contextual knowledge, especially in the form of contextual features, is beneficial for land use classification.

    本文的目的是研究基于单时间、多光谱、高分辨率航空图像数据的土地利用变化自动检测过程中能够实现的最大语义分辨率。为此，我们对土地利用类进行了逐步细化，这些类遵循大多数土地利用数据库对象目录的层次结构。本研究是在前人工作的基础上，同时对航空影像进行上下文分类，以确定土地覆盖和土地利用情况。土地覆盖是在小图像段的水平上确定的。土地利用分类应用于地理空间数据库中的对象。在两个具有不同特征的试验区进行了试验，旨在对土地利用等级的逐步细化进行实证评价。实验表明，十个类的语义解析仍然可以提供可接受的结果，其中结果的准确性取决于所使用的测试区域的特性。此外，我们还证实了语境知识的引入，特别是以语境特征的形式引入，有利于土地利用分类。

    In this letter, we apply the multifractal formalism to land cover change detection on very high spatial resolution data. Specifically, multifractal spectra are determined and, with modifications, are used as an initial general indicator of change on the subsets of IKONOS and Pleiades images. Next, we calculate Holder exponents for each pixel in the images and use them to generate a change mask. Our analysis shows that Holder exponents enable a detailed evaluation of changes in land cover. A comparison with change detection based solely on panchromatic images shows that the multifractal description method has significant advantages as it reduces the number of false positives. In addition, we show that our change detection results are comparable with other multiscale techniques.

    我们将多重分形形式应用于高空间分辨率数据的土地覆盖变化检测。具体地说，多重分形光谱是确定的，经过修改后，作为IKONOS和Pleiades图像子集变化的初始通用指标。接下来，我们计算图像中每个像素的Holder指数，并使用它们生成一个change mask。我们的分析表明，持股人指数能够详细评估土地覆盖的变化。与单纯基于全色图像的变化检测相比，多重分形描述方法具有明显的优点，可以减少误报的数量。此外，我们还证明了我们的变化检测结果可以与其他多尺度技术相比较。

    Our planet is facing unprecedented environmental challenges including rapid urbanization, deforestation, pollution, loss of biodiversity, sea-level rising, melting polar ice-caps and climate change. With its synoptic view and the repeatability, remote sensing offers a powerful and effective means to observe and monitor our changing planet at local, regional and global scale. Since the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972, numerous Earth Observation satellites have been launched providing large volumes of multitemporal data acquired by multispectral, hyperspectral, passive microwave, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and LiDAR sensors. This chapter first presents an overview of the Earth Observation sensors and trends in multitemporal observation capacity. Then the current status, challenges and opportunities of multitemporal remote sensing are discussed. Finally the synopsis of the book is provided covering a wide array of methods and techniques in processing and analysis of multitemporal remotely sensed images as well as a variety of application examples in both land and aquatic environments.

5.	Bruzzone, L., et al. (2016). **Change Detection in Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images**. （Book chapter）

    Multitemporal hyperspectral images provide very detailed spectral information that directly relates to land surface composition. This results in the potential detection of more spectral changes than those visible in the traditional multispectral images. However, the process of extracting changes from hyperspectral images is very complex. This chapter addresses the multiple-change detection problem in multitemporal hyperspectral remote sensing images by analyzing the complexity of this task. An analysis of the concept of "change" is given from the perspective of pixel spectral behaviors, in order to formalize the considered problem. A hierarchical change-detection approach is presented, which aims to identify the possible changes occurred between a pair of hyperspectral images. Changes having discriminable spectral behaviors in hyperspectral images are identified hierarchically by following a top-down structure in an unsupervised way. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real bi-temporal images confirm the validity of the proposed hierarchical change detection approach.

    多时相高光谱图像提供了非常详细的光谱信息，直接关系到陆地表面的组成。这导致了潜在的检测更多的光谱变化比那些在传统的多光谱图像可见。然而，从高光谱图像中提取变化的过程非常复杂。本章通过分析多时间高光谱遥感图像多变化检测的复杂性，解决了多变化检测问题。从象元光谱行为的角度分析了“变化”的概念，使所考虑的问题形式化。提出了一种分层变化检测方法，用于识别一对高光谱图像之间可能发生的变化。采用无监督自顶向下结构，分层识别高光谱图像中具有可识别光谱行为的变化。仿真和实际双时相图像的实验结果验证了该分层变化检测方法的有效性。

    In this study, we propose a novel object-oriented change detection method for remote-sensing images. First, the Gabor texture and Markov random field texture are extracted based on the remote- sensing images, and an initial pixel-level change detection result is produced. Second, in order to reduce the influence of feature uncertainty on the change detection results, the weights of different features are calculated by the Relief algorithm based on the initial pixel-level change detection result, and several difference images are fused to obtain a single comprehensive difference image. Third, different pixel-level change detection results are obtained using diverse change detection methods. The two-temporal images are then stacked and segmented, and to ensure change detection method separability, the weighted object change probability is obtained by fusing five different object change probabilities, which are calculated from the pixel-level change detection results. Finally, the objects are labelled as the class with a higher weighted object change probability. Our experimental results showed that the accuracy of change detection results obtained using the weighted object change probability was higher than that of the change detection results produced using the independent object change probability.

    提出了一种面向对象的遥感图像变化检测方法。首先，在遥感图像的基础上提取Gabor纹理和马尔可夫随机场纹理，得到初始的像素级变化检测结果。其次，为了减小特征不确定性对变化检测结果的影响，在初始像素级变化检测结果的基础上，采用浮雕算法计算不同特征的权值，融合多幅差分图像，得到一幅综合差分图像。第三，采用不同的变化检测方法，得到不同的像素级变化检测结果。然后对两个时间序列的图像进行叠加和分割，将五种不同的目标变化概率融合得到加权目标变化概率，并根据像素级的变化检测结果进行计算，以保证变化检测方法的可分性。最后，将对象标记为具有较高加权对象变化概率的类。实验结果表明，使用加权目标变化概率得到的变化检测结果的准确性高于使用独立目标变化概率得到的变化检测结果。

    An automatic change detection method based on conditional random field (CRF) is presented for high resolution remote sensing images in this paper. Marginalized denoising autoencoder is used to generate the difference image. The clustering results of Fuzzy C-means are applied to initialize the unary potentials of CRF. A scaled squared Euclidean distance between neighboring pixels in the observed images is introduced to define the pairwise potentials of CRF, which avoid training parameters and help improve the accuracy and the degree of automation. The experimental results obtained on different remote sensing images demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method.

    In this paper, we propose a novel technique for unsupervised change detection in high spatial remote sensing images based on a conditional random field (CRF) model. The change-detection problem is formulated as a labeling issue to discriminate the changed class from the unchanged class in the difference image. CRF which employs the spatial property on both pixel's spectral data and labels have been widely used in many remote sensing applications. However, as there are a large number of model parameters to train, the CRF-based change-detection approach is time consuming and difficult to implement. The proposed method artfully uses memberships of Fuzzy C-means as unary potentials and defines pairwise potentials using a scaled squared Euclidean distance between neighboring pixels. This not only avoids training parameters but also helps improving the accuracy and the degree of automation. The experimental results obtained from three different remote sensing images demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method.

    提出了一种基于条件随机场(CRF)模型的高空间遥感图像无监督变化检测新技术。将变化检测问题表示为一个标记问题，用于区分不同图像中变化的类和未变化的类。CRF利用像素光谱数据和标签的空间特性，在许多遥感应用中得到了广泛的应用。然而，由于需要训练大量的模型参数，基于crf的变化检测方法费时且难以实现。该方法巧妙地将模糊c均值的隶属度作为一元势，并利用相邻像素之间的平方欧氏距离定义成对势。这不仅避免了训练参数，而且有助于提高准确性和自动化程度。三幅不同遥感图像的实验结果表明了该方法的准确性和有效性。

    A new change-detection method for remote sensing images based on a conditional random field (CRF) model is proposed in this paper. The method artfully uses memberships of Fuzzy C-means as unary potentials in the fully connected CRF (FCCRF) model without training parameters, and pairwise potentials of the CRF model are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels, with which a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm can be used. The proposed FCCRF model is expressed on the complete set of pixels in both the observed multitemporal images, which can incorporate long range contextual information of remote-sensing images and enable greatly refined change-detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to more accurate pixel-level change-detection performance and is more robust against noise than traditional algorithms.

    Building change detection from very-high-resolution (VHR) urban remote sensing image frequently encounter the challenge of serious false alarm caused by different illumination or viewing angles in bi-temporal images. An approach to alleviate the false alarm in urban building change detection is proposed in this paper. Firstly, as shadows casted by urban buildings are of distinct spectral and shape feature, it adopts a supervised object-based classification technique to extract them in this paper. Secondly, on the opposite direction of sunlight illumination, a straight line is drawn along the principal orientation of building in every extracted shadow region. Starting from the straight line and moving toward the sunlight direction, a rectangular area is constructed to cover partial shadow and rooftop of each building. Thirdly, an algebra and geometry invariant based method is used to abstract the spatial topological relationship of the potential unchanged buildings from all central points of the rectangular area. Finally, based on an oriented texture curvature descriptor, an index is established to determine the actual false alarm in building change detection result. The experiment results validate that the proposed method can be used as an effective framework to alleviate the false alarm in building change detection from urban VHR image.

    超高分辨率城市遥感影像的建筑物变化检测在双时相图像中经常遇到因光照或视角不同而造成的严重误报的挑战。提出了一种减轻城市建筑变化检测中虚警的方法。首先，由于城市建筑阴影具有明显的光谱和形状特征，本文采用基于监督对象的分类技术对其进行提取。其次，在阳光照射的相反方向上，在每个提取的阴影区域沿着建筑的主方向画一条直线。从直线开始，向阳光方向移动，构建一个矩形区域，覆盖每个建筑的部分阴影和屋顶。第三，利用代数和几何不变量方法，从矩形区域的所有中心点抽象出潜在不变建筑的空间拓扑关系。最后，基于面向纹理曲率描述符，建立了一个指标来确定建筑物变化检测结果中的实际虚警。实验结果表明，该方法可以有效地缓解城市VHR图像中建筑物变化检测的虚警问题。

    Change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing images has usually been treated as a problem of explicitly detecting land cover transitions. To date, multi-dimensional change vector analysis has been an effective solution to such problems. However, using change vector analysis makes it hard to calculate multiple directions or kinds of change. Through combining multi-feature object-based image analysis and change vector analysis, this paper presents a novel method for object-based change detection of multiple changes. Our technique, named self-adaptive weight-change vector analysis, carries out: (1) change vector analysis to determine magnitude and direction of changes; and (2) self-adaptive weight-based analysis of the standard deviation of image objects. Furthermore, a polar representation has been adopted to acquire visual change information for image objects. This paper proposes an automatic technique that can be applied to the field of multi-feature object-based change detection for very high resolution remotely sensed images. The two-step automatic detection strategy includes extraction of changed objects using an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the threshold under a Gaussian assumption, and identification of different kinds of changes using a K-means clustering algorithm. The effectiveness of our approach has been tested on both multispectral and panchromatic fusion images. Results of these two experimental cases confirm that this approach can detect multiple kinds of change. We found that self-adaptive weight-change vector analysis had superior capabilities of object-based change detection compared with standard change vector analysis, yielding Kappa statistics of 0.7976 and 0.7508 for Cases 1 and 2, respectively.

    在多时相遥感图像中，变化检测通常被看作是一个显式检测地表覆盖变化的问题。迄今为止，多维变化矢量分析是解决这类问题的有效方法。然而，使用变化向量分析使得计算多个方向或多种变化变得困难。将基于多特征对象的图像分析与变化矢量分析相结合，提出了一种基于对象的多变化检测新方法。我们的技术，称为自适应权值变化向量分析，进行:(1)变化向量分析，确定变化的大小和方向;(2)基于自适应加权的图像目标标准差分析。此外，采用极坐标表示方法获取图像对象的视觉变化信息。提出了一种适用于高分辨率遥感图像多特征对象变化检测领域的自动检测技术。两步自动检测策略包括使用期望最大化算法提取变化对象，估计高斯假设下的阈值，并使用k -均值聚类算法识别不同类型的变化。在多光谱和全色融合图像上验证了该方法的有效性。实验结果表明，该方法可以检测多种变化。我们发现自适应权值变化向量分析与标准变化向量分析相比具有更好的基于对象的变化检测能力，场景1和场景2的Kappa统计量分别为0.7976和0.7508。

    Remote sensing images with clouds, shadows or stripes are usually considered as defective data which limit their application for change detection. This paper proposes a method to fuse a series of defective images as evidences for change detection. In the proposed method, post-classification comparison process is firstly performed on multi-source defective images. Then, the classification results of all the images, together with their corresponding confusion matrixes are used to calculate the Basic Belief Assignment (BBA) of each pixel. Further, based on the principle of Dempster- Shafer evidence theory, a BBA redistribution process is introduced to deal with the defective parts of multi-source data. At last, evidential fusion and decision making rules are applied on the pixel level, and the final map of change detection can be derived. The proposed method can finish change detection with data fusion and image completion in one integrated process, which makes use of the complementary and redundant information from the input images. The method is applied to a case study of landslide barrier lake formed in Aug. 3rd, 2014, with a series of multispectral images from different sensors of GF-1 satellite. Result shows that the proposed method can not only complete the defective parts of the input images, but also provide better change detection accuracy than post- classification comparison method with single pair of pre- and post-change images. Subsequent analysis indicates that high conflict degree between evidences is the main source of errors in the result. Finally, some possible reasons that result in evidence conflict on the pixel level are analysed. 

    云、影、条带遥感图像通常被认为是有缺陷的数据，限制了其变化检测的应用。提出了一种融合一系列缺陷图像的方法，作为变化检测的依据。该方法首先对多源缺陷图像进行后分类比较。然后，将所有图像的分类结果及其对应的混淆矩阵用于计算每个像素的基本信念分配(Basic Belief Assignment, BBA)。在此基础上，基于Dempster- Shafer证据理论原理，提出了一种BBA重分布方法来处理多源数据中存在的缺陷。最后在像素级应用证据融合和决策规则，得到最终的变化检测图。该方法利用输入图像的互补和冗余信息，实现了数据融合和图像补全一体化的变化检测。将该方法应用于2014年8月3日形成的滑坡堰塞湖的实例研究中，利用GF-1卫星不同传感器获取的多光谱图像进行了研究。结果表明，该方法不仅可以完成输入图像的缺陷部分，而且比单对前后图像的分类后比较法具有更好的变化检测精度。随后的分析表明，证据之间的高度冲突是导致结果错误的主要原因。最后，分析了可能导致像素级证据冲突的原因。

    Active learning (AL) has emerged as a versatile approach to reduce the training data required for remote sensing image classification, but its use for the analysis of satellite image time series (SITS) has not been explored yet. This study targets to explore a new object-based framework for change detection in SITS, combining the state-of-the-art spatio-temporal clustering and the use of different machine learning algorithms. Indeed, this study aims at testing whether standard machine learning algorithms can detect changes in long time series and whether AL can improve the results compared to traditional supervised learning. The tested AL algorithms comprise random forest-based heuristics that use a combination of uncertainty and diversity criteria, and a classical SVM breaking ties heuristic. The different implementations are evaluated with two datasets that depict changes around the Arcachon basin (West of France) and around the city of Colmar (East of France) spanning over more than 20 years and comprising four change classes (urban sprawl, forest gain, forest loss, and other). The tests demonstrate that steeper learning curves can be obtained with AL when compared to supervised learning. However, the performance of different AL algorithms depends on the dataset.

    主动学习(AL)已成为减少遥感图像分类所需训练数据的一种通用方法，但其用于卫星图像时间序列(sit)分析的研究尚未开展。本研究的目标是探索一种新的基于对象的框架，结合最先进的时空聚类和不同的机器学习算法来检测sit中的变化。事实上，本研究的目的在于检验标准的机器学习算法是否能够检测长时间序列的变化，以及AL是否能够改善传统监督学习的结果。所测试的人工智能算法包括随机森林启发式算法和经典的支持向量机破环启发式算法。使用两个数据集对不同的实现进行评估，这两个数据集描述了跨越20多年的Arcachon盆地(法国西部)和Colmar市(法国东部)周围的变化，包括四个变化类(城市扩张、森林增加、森林损失等)。实验表明，与有监督学习相比，人工智能可以获得更陡峭的学习曲线。然而，不同算法的性能取决于数据集。

    The analysis of multi-temporal remote-sensing images is one of the main applications in Earth's observation and monitoring. In this paper, we present a Matlab toolbox for change detection analysis of optical multi-temporal remote-sensing data in which unsupervised approaches, iterative principal component analysis (ITPCA), and iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) are implemented and optimized. The optimization is represented by the implementation of novel pre- and post-processing strategies that aim to mitigate the side effects introduced by different acquisition conditions affecting change detection analysis. Special modules have been designed in order to decrease the required memory when large data sets are processed.

    In the process of object-oriented change detection, the determination of the optimal segmentation scale is directly related to the subsequent change information extraction and analysis. Aiming at this problem, this paper presents a novel object-level change detection method based on multi-scale segmentation and fusion. First of all, the fine to coarse segmentation is used to obtain initial objects of different sizes; then, according to the features of the objects, Change Vector Analysis is used to obtain the change detection results of various scales. Furthermore, in order to improve the accuracy of change detection, this paper introduces fuzzy fusion and two kinds of decision level fusion methods to get the results of multi-scale fusion. Based on these methods, experiments are done with SPOTS multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. Compared with pixel-level change detection methods, the overall accuracy of our method has been improved by nearly 10%, and the experimental results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the fusion strategies.

    在面向对象的变化检测过程中，最优分割尺度的确定直接关系到后续变化信息的提取和分析。针对这一问题，提出了一种基于多尺度分割融合的目标级变化检测方法。首先，利用精细到粗分割得到不同尺寸的初始目标;然后，根据目标的特点，利用变化矢量分析得到不同尺度的变化检测结果。此外，为了提高变化检测的精度，引入模糊融合和两种决策级融合方法，得到多尺度融合的结果。在此基础上，对斑点多光谱遥感图像进行了实验研究。与像素级变化检测方法相比，该方法的整体精度提高了近10%，实验结果证明了融合策略的可行性和有效性。

    With the increase of multisource data available from remote sensing platforms, it is demanding to develop unsupervised techniques for change detection from multisource data. The difference in imaging mechanism makes it difficult to carry out a direct comparison between multisource data in original observation spaces. Different sensors provide different descriptions on the same truth in low-dimension observation spaces, but the same truth indicates the comparability of multisource data in some high-dimensional feature spaces. Inspired by this, we try to solve this problem by transforming multisource data into a common high-dimension feature space. In this paper, an iterative coupled dictionary learning (CDL) model is proposed for multisource image change detection. This model aims to establish a pair of coupled dictionaries, one of which is responsible for the data from one sensor, whereas the other is responsible for the data from another sensor. The atoms from these two coupled dictionaries have a one-to-one correspondence at the same location.Such a property guarantees the transferability of the reconstruction coefficients between bitemporal patch pairs and provides us a desired mechanism to bridge multisource data and highlight changes. The contributions can be summarized as follows: CDL is designed to explore the intrinsic difference of multisource data for change detection in a high-dimension feature space, and an iterative scheme for unsupervised sample selection is proposed to keep the purity of training samples and gradually optimize the current coupled dictionaries. The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed framework.

    随着遥感平台多源数据量的增加，对多源数据变化检测的无监督技术提出了更高的要求。成像机理的差异使得原始观测空间的多源数据难以进行直接比较。在低维观测空间中，不同的传感器对同一真值有不同的描述，但同一真值表明在某些高维特征空间中多源数据具有可比性。受此启发，我们试图通过将多源数据转换为一个常见的高维特征空间来解决这个问题。提出了一种用于多源图像变化检测的迭代耦合字典学习(CDL)模型。该模型旨在建立一对耦合字典，其中一个字典负责一个传感器的数据，另一个字典负责另一个传感器的数据。这两个耦合字典中的原子在同一位置有一一对应关系。这种特性保证了双孔patch对之间重建系数的可移植性，并为我们提供了一种理想的机制来桥接多源数据并突出显示变化。的贡献可以概括如下:CDL旨在探索的内在差异的多源数据在高维特征空间变化检测,无监督样本选择和迭代方案提出了保持纯洁的训练样本,逐步优化当前的字典。实验结果验证了该框架的可行性、有效性和鲁棒性。

    This study proposes a superpixel-based active contour model (SACM) for unsupervised change detection from satellite images. The accuracy of change detection produced by the traditional active contour model suffers from the trade-off parameter. The SACM is designed to address this limitation through the incorporation of the spatial and statistical information of superpixels. The proposed method mainly consists of three steps. First, the difference image is created with change vector analysis method from two temporal satellite images. Second, statistical region merging method is applied on the difference image to produce a superpixel map. Finally, SACM is designed based on the superpixel map to detect changes from the difference image. The SACM incorporates spatial and statistical information and retains the accurate shapes and outlines of superpixels. Experiments were conducted on two data sets, namely Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and SPOT 5, to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that SACM reduces the effects of the trade-off parameter. The proposed method also increases the robustness of the traditional active contour model for input parameters and improves its effectiveness. In summary, SACM often outperforms some existing methods and provides an effective unsupervised change detection method.

    Change detection (CD) based on remote sensing images plays an important role in Earth observation. However, the CD accuracy is usually affected by sunlight and atmospheric conditions and sensor calibration. In this study, a scale-driven CD method incorporating uncertainty analysis is proposed to increase CD accuracy. First, two temporal images are stacked and segmented into multiscale segmentation maps. Then, a pixel-based change map with memberships belonging to changed and unchanged parts is obtained by fuzzy c-means clustering. Finally, based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, the proposed scale-driven CD method incorporating uncertainty analysis is performed on the multiscale segmentation maps and the pixel-based change map. Two experiments were carried out on Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and SPOT 5 data sets. The ratio of total errors can be reduced to 4.0% and 7.5% for the ETM+ and SPOT 5 data sets in this study, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms some state-of-the-art CD methods and provides an effective solution for CD.

    In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised change detection method designed to analyze multispectral remotely sensed image pairs. It is formulated as a segmentation problem to discriminate the changed class from the unchanged class in the difference images. The proposed method is in the category of the committee machine learning model that utilizes an ensemble of classifiers (i.e., the set of segmentation results obtained by several thresholding methods) with a dynamic structure type. More specifically, in order to obtain the final "change/no-change" output, the responses of several classifiers are combined by means of a mechanism that involves the input data (the difference image) under an iterative Bayesian-Markovian framework. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to previously published results using satellite imagery.

International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2016, 9880: 988011.

    In this study, we present an unsupervised change detection method using multi-spectral and multi- temporal remotely sensed imageries. This method is a pre-classification approach based on a spectral rule-based per-pixel classifier (SRC) developed by Baraldi et al. (2006). SRC is purely based on spectral-domain prior knowledge, such that no training or supervision process is needed. To explore its capability to detect change, we applied it in the Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang, China. First, images were classified by SRC, and change detection was performed by two separate methods. One was the comparison of the merged categories obtained by reclassifying the pre-classification types of SRC. The other was comparing bi-temporal pre-classification types directly. The classification accuracy of the merged categories based on SRC was compared to the Maximum Likelihood Classifier and Support Vector Machine. The accuracy of the change detection was assessed and compared to results processed by the common post-classification comparison and change vector analysis methods. Results show that the change detection by directly comparing pre- classification types of SRC had the highest accuracy (overall accuracy was 90%, kappa coefficient was 0.81) among these methods and that the method of comparing merged categories was the worst (overall accuracy was 73%, kappa coefficient was only 0.46).

    在本研究中，我们提出了一种利用多光谱和多时相遥感影像进行无监督变化检测的方法。该方法是基于Baraldi等人(2006)开发的基于光谱规则的每像素分类器(SRC)的预分类方法。SRC完全基于频谱域先验知识，因此不需要任何培训或监督过程。为了探索其检测变化的能力，我们将其应用于中国浙江舟山群岛。首先，利用SRC对图像进行分类，采用两种不同的方法进行变化检测。一是对SRC预分类类型进行重新分类得到的合并类别进行比较。另一种是直接比较双时相预分类类型。将基于SRC的合并类别分类精度与最大似然分类器和支持向量机进行了比较。评价变化检测的准确性，并与常用的分类后比较和变化向量分析方法处理的结果进行比较。结果表明，直接比较SRC预分类类型的变化检测在这些方法中准确率最高(总准确率为90%，kappa系数为0.81)，合并类别的比较方法最差(总准确率为73%，kappa系数仅为0.46)。

    The difficulty of very high resolution image change detection lies in the low interclass separability between the changed class and the unchanged class. According to experiments, we found that this separability can be improved by mining the relationship contained in the training samples. Based
    on this observation, a supervised change detection approach is proposed in this paper based on relationship learning. The proposed approach begins with enriching the training samples based on their neighborhood relationship and label coherence; this relationship is then learned simultaneously with the classifier, and, finally, the latter classification performance benefits from the learned relationship. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    This article presents a novel semi-supervised change detection approach for very-high-resolution (VHR) remote-sensing images. The proposed approach aims at extracting the change information by making full use of the context-sensitive relationships among pixels in the images. This is accomplished via a context-sensitive image representation technique based on hypergraph model. First, each temporal image is modelled as a hypergraph that utilizes a set of hyperedges to capture the context-sensitive properties of pixels in the image. Second, the difference in the bi-temporal images is measured by both the similarity and the consistency between the two hypergraphs. Finally, the changes are separated from the unchanged ones by a hypergraph-based semi-supervised classifier on the difference image. Experimental results obtained on different VHR remote-sensing data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    Change Vector Analysis (CVA) is an important change detection method for remote sensing imagery with medium and low resolution. Traditional CVA is a pixel-based method, which is insufficient for high-resolution (HR) imagery. An object-oriented change vector analysis method (OCVA) is proposed in the paper. Image segmentation method was used to get image objects. The object histogtam was extracted as the feature of the image object at different bands. G statistic was employed to measure the distance between the object histograms at two times. Change vector of the object was built by the histogram distance at different bands. The heterogeneity of the object was measured by the magnitude of the object change vector. The threshold to detect change/no change objects was decided by Otsu method which maximizes the variance between change objects and unchanged objects. The experimental results on QuickBird images show that OCVA can make full use of the spatial information in HR images and get higher accuracy than pixel-based CVA.

    The development of remote sensing has enabled the acquisition of information on land-cover change at different spatial scales. However, a tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions normally exists. Fine-spatial-resolution images have low temporal resolutions, whereas coarse-spatial- resolution images have high temporal repetition rates. A novel superresolution change detection method (SRCD) is proposed to detect land-cover changes at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions with the use of a coarse-resolution image and a fine-resolution land-cover map acquired at different times. SRCD is an iterative method that involves endmember estimation, spectral unmixing, land-cover fraction change detection, and superresolution land-cover mapping. Both the land-cover change/no-change map and from-to change map at fine spatial resolution can be generated by SRCD. In this paper, SRCD was applied to a synthetic multispectral image, a Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer multispectral image, and a Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager multispectral image. The land-cover from-to change maps are found to have the highest overall accuracy (higher than 85%) in all of the three experiments. Most of the changed land-cover patches, which were larger than the coarse-resolution pixel, were correctly detected.

    In this letter, a multifeature probabilistic ensemble conditional random field (MFPECRF) model is proposed to perform the task of change detection for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. MFPECRF not only considers the spectral feature of single pixels but also the interaction between neighborhood pixels and the structural property of the ground objects in HSR imagery to give a higher detection accuracy than the traditional random field methods, which only utilize spectral and label information. In the unary potential, the spectral and morphological features of the difference image are combined using a probabilistic ensemble strategy, and the pairwise potential considers the contextual information of the observed field. The parameters of MFPECRF are estimated using a piecewise strategy, and the final result is obtained by the use of the loopy belief propagation algorithm. The experimental results of two groups of HSR multispectral images confirm the potential of the proposed method in improving the detection accuracy for HSR imagery.

    In this paper, an unsupervised change detection model based on hybrid conditional random field model (HCRF) is proposed for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. Traditional random field based algorithms are mainly based on the analysis of the difference image which ignores the spatial-temporal change information of ground objects which is important in dealing with HSR imagery. Thus in HCRF, a new graph structure is designed to explore the correlation of corresponding ground objects from different times to get a better result. The unary potential is selected as the probabilistic result of change vector analysis (CVA), the pairwise potential is modeled to consider the contextual information of difference image and the similarity between objects from bi-temporal original images is considered using an object term. The proposed method is tested on two HSR data sets (IKONOS and QuickBird) and outperforms some state-of-art algorithms.

    In this paper, a novel change detection method learned from Recurrent Neural Network with transferable ability is proposed. The proposed method, which is based on an improved Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, aims at: 1) learning a novel change detection rule to distinguish changed regions with high accuracy; 2) analyzing a new target data with transferable ability from learned change rule; 3) learning the differencing information and detecting the changes independently without any classifiers. In the process of learning the change rule, a core memory cell is utilized to detect and record the differencing information in multi-temporal images; meanwhile,the memory cell can update the storage by iteration for optimization.

    When exploited in remote sensing analysis, a reliable change rule with transfer ability can detect changes accurately and be applied widely. However, in practice, the complexity of land cover changes makes it difficult to use only one change rule or change feature learned from a given multi- temporal dataset to detect any other new target images without applying other learning processes. In this study, we consider the design of an efficient change rule having transferability to detect both binary and multi-class changes. The proposed method relies on an improved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to acquire and record the change information of long-term sequence remote sensing data. In particular, a core memory cell is utilized to learn the change rule from the information concerning binary changes or multi-class changes. Three gates are utilized to control the input, output and update of the LSTM model for optimization. In addition, the learned rule can be applied to detect changes and transfer the change rule from one learned image to another new target multi-temporal image. In this study, binary experiments, transfer experiments and multi-class change experiments are exploited to demonstrate the superiority of our method. Three contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) the proposed method can learn an effective change rule to provide reliable change information for multi-temporal images; (2) the learned change rule has good transferability for detecting changes in new target images without any extra learning process, and the new target images should have a multi-spectral distribution similar to that of the training images; and (3) to the authors' best knowledge, this is the first time that deep learning in recurrent neural networks is exploited for change detection. In addition, under the framework of the proposed method, changes can be detected under both binary detection and multi-class change detection.

    当应用于遥感分析时，具有传递能力的可靠变化规律可以准确地检测变化并得到广泛应用。然而，在实践中，由于土地覆盖变化的复杂性，在不应用其他学习过程的情况下，很难仅使用从给定的多时间数据集中学习到的一个变化规则或变化特征来检测任何其他新的目标图像。在本研究中，我们考虑设计一个有效的变化规则，该规则具有检测二进制和多类变化的可转移性。该方法利用改进的长短时记忆(LSTM)模型获取和记录长序列遥感数据的变化信息。特别是，使用核心内存单元从有关二值变化或多类变化的信息中学习变化规则。利用三个门控制LSTM模型的输入、输出和更新，进行优化。此外，该规则可用于检测变化，并将变化规则从一个学习图像转移到另一个新的目标多时间图像。在本研究中，利用二元实验、传递实验和多类变换实验来验证该方法的优越性。本工作的三个贡献可以总结为:(1)提出的方法可以学习有效的变化规律，为多时相图像提供可靠的变化信息;(2)所学习的变化规律对于检测新目标图像的变化具有良好的可移植性，不需要任何额外的学习过程，新目标图像应具有与训练图像相似的多光谱分布;(3)据作者所知，这是第一次利用递归神经网络中的深度学习进行变化检测。此外，在该方法的框架下，既可以检测二值变化，也可以检测多类变化。

    Object-based change detection (OBCD) has recently been receiving increasing attention as a result of rapid improvements in the resolution of remote sensing data. However, some OBCD issues relating to the segmentation of high-resolution images remain to be explored. For example, segmentation units derived using different segmentation strategies, segmentation scales, feature space, and change detection methods have rarely been assessed. In this study, we have tested four common unsupervised change detection methods using different segmentation strategies and a series of segmentation scale parameters on two WorldView-2 images of urban areas. We have also evaluated the effect of adding extra textural and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) information instead of using only spectral information. Our results indicated that change detection methods performed better at a medium scale than at a fine scale where close to the pixel size. Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) always outperformed the other methods tested, at the same confidence level. The overall accuracy appeared to benefit from using a two-date segmentation strategy rather than single-date segmentation. Adding textural and NDVI information appeared to reduce detection accuracy, but the magnitude of this reduction was not consistent across the different unsupervised methods and segmentation strategies. We conclude that a two-date segmentation strategy is useful for change detection in high-resolution imagery, but that the optimization of thresholds is critical for unsupervised change detection methods. Advanced methods need be explored that can take advantage of additional textural or other parameters.

    由于遥感数据分辨率的快速提高，基于对象的变化检测（OBCD）最近受到越来越多的关注。但是，有关高分辨率图像分割的一些 OBCD 问题仍有待探索。例如，很少评估使用不同分割策略，分割尺度，特征空间和变化检测方法导出的分割单元。在这项研究中，我们使用不同的分割策略和两个城市区域的 WorldView-2 图像上的一系列分割尺度参数测试了四种常见的无监督变化检测方法。我们还评估了添加额外纹理和归一化差异植被指数（NDVI）信息的效果，而不是仅使用光谱信息。我们的结果表明，变化检测方法在中等规模上比在接近像素尺寸的精细尺度下表现更好。多变量检测（MAD）在相同的置信水平下总是优于其他测试方法。总体准确性似乎受益于使用两日期分割策略而不是单日期分割。添加纹理和NDVI 信息似乎降低了检测准确性，但是这种减少的幅度在不同的无监督方法和分割策略中并不一致。我们得出结论，两阶段分割策略对于高分辨率图像中的变化检测是有用的，但阈值的优化对于无监督变化检测方法是至关重要的。需要探索可以利用额外的纹理或其他参数的高级方法。

    This paper proposes a novel unsupervised change detection model at pixel level based on Pulse- Coupled Neural Networks (PCNN) combined with Change Vector Analysis (CVA). The proposed algorithm has the following steps: (a) computation of Difference Image (DI) corresponding to the magnitudes of Spectral Change Vectors (SCV); (b) evaluation of the total number of firings of each PCNN neuron for a given interval, by assuming the DI as the input image for PCNN; (c) two-class clustering of the firing accumulator content for each PCNN neuron to deduce pixel change map. The model is evaluated using a Landsat-5 image set acquired on a Mexico area before and after two wildfires. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. The exciting novelty of the proposed model over the classical PCNN change detection techniques consist both of its marriage PCNN-CVA and of that it produces an effective change detection at pixel level instead of change detection at patch level, characterizing the previous PCNN change detection approaches.

    Although there have been many studies for change detection, the effective and efficient use of high resolution remote sensing images is still a problem. Conventional supervised methods need lots of annotations to classify the land cover categories and detect their changes. Besides, the training set in supervised methods often has lots of redundant samples without any essential information. In this study, we present a method for interactive change detection using high resolution remote sensing images with active learning to overcome the shortages of existing remote sensing image change detection techniques. In our method, there is no annotation of actual land cover category at the beginning. First, we find a certain number of the most representative objects in unsupervised way. Then, we can detect the change areas from multi-temporal high resolution remote sensing images by active learning with Gaussian processes in an interactive way gradually until the detection results do not change notably. The artificial labelling can be reduced substantially, and a desirable detection result can be obtained in a few iterations. The experiments on Geo-Eye1 and WorldView2 remote sensing images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

    虽然关于变化检测的研究已经有了很多，但如何有效、高效地利用高分辨率遥感图像仍然是一个问题。传统的监测方法需要大量的标注来对土地覆被类别进行分类并检测其变化。此外，监督方法中的训练集往往存在大量的冗余样本，没有任何必要的信息。针对现有遥感图像变化检测技术的不足，提出了一种基于主动学习的高分辨率遥感图像交互变化检测方法。在我们的方法中，一开始并没有对实际的土地覆盖类别进行标注。首先，我们以无监督的方式找到一定数量的最具代表性的对象。然后，通过高斯过程的主动学习，以交互的方式逐步检测多时间高分辨率遥感图像的变化区域，直到检测结果没有明显变化。该方法大大降低了人工标记量，经过几次迭代就可以得到理想的检测结果。通过对Geo-Eye1和WorldView2遥感图像的实验验证了该方法的有效性和有效性。

    Chi-squared transform (CST), as a statistical method, can describe the difference degree between vectors. The CST-based methods operate directly on information stored in the difference image and are simple and effective methods for detecting changes in remotely sensed images that have been registered and aligned. However, the technique does not take spatial information into consideration, which leads to much noise in the result of change detection. An improved unsupervised change detection method is proposed based on spatial constraint CST (SCCST) in combination with a Markov random field (MRF) model. First, the mean and variance matrix of the difference image of bitemporal images are estimated by an iterative trimming method. In each iteration, spatial information is injected to reduce scattered changed points (also known as "salt and pepper" noise). To determine the key parameter confidence level in the SCCST method, a pseudotraining dataset is constructed to estimate the optimal value. Then, the result of SCCST, as an initial solution of change detection, is further improved by the MRF model. The experiments on simulated and real multitemporal and multispectral images indicate that the proposed method performs well in comprehensive indices compared with other methods. 

    卡方变换(CST)作为一种统计方法，可以描述向量之间的差异程度。基于cst的方法直接对存储在差分图像中的信息进行操作，是一种简单有效的检测已注册和对齐的遥感图像变化的方法。但是，该方法没有考虑空间信息，导致变化检测结果噪声较大。结合马尔可夫随机场模型，提出了一种基于空间约束CST (SCCST)的改进无监督变化检测方法。首先，用迭代裁剪法估计双孔图像差分图像的均值和方差矩阵。在每次迭代中，注入空间信息以减少分散的变化点(也称为“盐和胡椒”噪声)。为了确定SCCST方法的关键参数置信度，构造了一个伪训练数据集来估计最优值。然后，利用MRF模型进一步改进了作为变化检测初始解的SCCST结果。对模拟和真实多时间、多光谱图像的实验表明，与其他方法相比，该方法具有较好的综合指标。

    This letter presents a novel framework for the analysis of difference image (DI) in unsupervised change detection problems based on fuzzy topology. First, the DI is softly categorized into unchanged and changed classes. In other words, a membership function is computed for each class. Second, each class is decomposed into three parts - interior, fuzzy boundary and exterior - by analysing its membership function through fuzzy topology. Third, for each class, its interior pixels which have a high membership degree are classified as the current class; its exterior, denoting the interior and fuzzy boundary parts of the other class, is ignored; and its fuzzy boundary pixels associated with a low membership degree are reclassified using the supported connectivity in fuzzy topology. As a result, the proposed approach can solve the problem of misclassifying pixels in the fuzzy boundary of unchanged or changed class to some extent, providing improved change detection accuracy. Experiments were conducted on two different datasets and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

    本文提出了一种新的基于模糊拓扑的无监督变化检测问题差分图像分析框架。首先，DI被柔和地分为未变化的类和已变化的类。换句话说，计算每个类的成员函数。其次，利用模糊拓扑分析类的隶属度函数，将每个类分解为内部类、模糊边界类和外部类。第三，对于每个类，将其隶属度高的内部像素划分为当前类;它的外部，表示另一类的内部和模糊边界部分，被忽略;利用模糊拓扑中支持的连通性对隶属度较低的模糊边界像素进行重新分类。结果表明，该方法在一定程度上解决了未变类或已变类模糊边界中像素分类错误的问题，提高了变化检测精度。在两个不同的数据集上进行了实验，结果验证了该框架的有效性。

    In this paper, we present a new framework for building change detection from monocular aerial imagery that automatically predicts building candidates based on adaptive local textural features with successive background removal. An adaptive local entropy feature is developed based on quadratic regression and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) for extracting potential building candidates. Then a majority voting aggregation strategy is employed to accurately estimate shadow direction associated with building objects to aid in reducing false positives in the detected building candidates. A ground plane estimation method is proposed to distinguish building and non-building objects that share similar textural features. Finally, to better estimate changes in building area, a double convex hull based morphological merging technique is introduced. The evaluation results of the proposed framework performed on three-band (RGB) aerial images indicate its capability to successfully detect building changes in urban, suburban, and rural areas.

    Remote sensing technology is increasingly being used for rapid detection and visualization of changes caused by catastrophic events. This paper presents a semi-automated feature-based approach to the identification of building conditions especially in affected areas using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing information. For image analysis, a new "detected part of contour" (DPC) feature is developed for the assessment of building integrity. The DPC calculates a part of the building contour that can be detected in the remotely sensed image. Additional texture features provide information about the area inside the buildings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by high overall classification accuracy for two different study cases. The results demonstrate that the "map-to-image" strategy enables extracting valuable information from the remotely sensed image for each individual vector object, thereby being a better choice for change detection within urban areas.

    When dealing with optical images, the most common approach to unsupervised change detection is Change Vector Analysis (CVA) which computes the multispectral difference image and exploits its statistical distribution in (hyper-) spherical coordinates. The latter step usually requires assumptions on both the model of class distributions and the number of changes. However, both assumptions are seldom satisfied especially when multisensor VHR images are considered. Thus, we propose an approach to multiple change detection in multisensor VHR optical images based on iterative clustering in (hyper-) spherical coordinate. The proposed approach is distribution free, unsupervised and automatically identifies the number of changes. Results obtained on a multitemporal and multisensor dataset including images from WorldView-2 and QuickBird are promising.

    在处理光学图像时，最常用的无监督变化检测方法是变化矢量分析(CVA)，它计算多光谱差分图像，并利用其在(超)球坐标下的统计分布。后一个步骤通常需要对类分布的模型和变化的数量进行假设。然而，这两种假设很少得到满足，尤其是考虑多传感器VHR图像时。为此，提出了一种基于超球面坐标迭代聚类的多传感器VHR光学图像多变化检测方法。该方法是自由分布的，无监督的，并自动识别变化的数量。在包括WorldView-2和QuickBird图像在内的多时间和多传感器数据集上获得的结果是有希望的。

    Change detection (CD) is an active research topic in remote sensing applications including urban studies, disaster assessment, and deforestation monitoring. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for CD in high-resolution remote sensing images that uses a novel strategy for the selection of training samples and an ensemble of multiple classifiers. As for the selection of training samples, our proposed method uses two groups of thresholds instead of just one threshold to enhance the quality of the selected training samples by allowing for their selection in an intelligent manner. In order to achieve high CD accuracy, spatial information such as texture and morphological profiles are utilized in conjunction with spectral information. Our multiple classifier system (MCS) exploits the extreme learning machine (ELM), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. To validate our newly proposed approach, we conduct experiments using multispectral images collected by ZY3. The proposed method provides state-of-the-art CD accuracies as compared with other approaches widely used in the literature for CD purposes.

    The analysis of rapid land cover/land use changes by means of remote sensing is often based on data acquired under varying and occasionally unfavorable conditions. In addition, such analyses frequently use data acquired by different sensor systems. These acquisitions often differ with respect to sun position and sensor viewing geometry which lead to characteristic effects in each image. These differences may have a negative impact on reliable change detection. Here, we propose an approach called Robust Change Vector Analysis (RCVA), aiming to mitigate these effects. RCVA is an improvement of the widely-used Change Vector Analysis (CVA), developed to account for pixel neighborhood effects. We used a RapidEye and Kompsat-2 cross-sensor change detection test to demonstrate the efficiency of RCVA. Our analysis showed that RCVA results in fewer false negatives as well as false positives when compared to CVA under similar test conditions. We conclude that RCVA is a powerful technique which can be utilized to reduce spurious changes in bi-temporal change detection analyses based on high- or very-high spatial resolution imagery. 

    利用遥感手段分析土地覆被/土地利用的迅速变化往往是根据在各种不同和偶尔不利条件下获得的数据。此外，这种分析经常使用不同传感器系统获得的数据。这些获取通常与太阳位置和传感器观察几何形状有关，这导致在每张图像中产生特征效果。这些差异可能对可靠的变化检测产生负面影响。在此，我们提出了一种称为鲁棒变化向量分析(RCVA)的方法，旨在减轻这些影响。RCVA是广泛使用的变化矢量分析(CVA)的改进，CVA用于考虑像素邻域效应。我们使用RapidEye和Kompsat-2交叉传感器变化检测实验来验证RCVA的有效性。我们的分析表明，在相似的测试条件下，与CVA相比，RCVA的假阴性和假阳性更少。结果表明，在基于高分辨率或甚高分辨率图像的双时间变化检测分析中，RCVA是一种有效的抑制杂散变化的方法。

    There is an increasing demand for robust methods on urban sprawl monitoring. The steadily increasing number of high resolution and multi-view sensors allows producing datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution; however, less effort has been dedicated to employ very high resolution (VHR) satellite image time series (SITS) to monitor the changes in buildings with higher accuracy. In addition, these VHR data are often acquired from different sensors. The objective of this research is to propose a robust time-series data analysis method for VHR stereo imagery. Firstly, the spatial-temporal information of the stereo imagery and the Digital Surface Models (DSMs) generated from them are combined, and building probability maps (BPM) are calculated for all acquisition dates. In the second step, an object-based change analysis is performed based on the derivative features of the BPM sets. The change consistence between object-level and pixel-level are checked to remove any outlier pixels. Results are assessed on six pairs of VHR satellite images acquired within a time span of 7 years. The evaluation results have proved the efficiency of the proposed method.

    In this paper, we propose a modular, scalable, metric-free, single-shot change detection/registration method. The developed framework exploits the relation between the registration and change detection problems, while under a fruitful synergy, the coupling energy term constrains adequately both tasks. In particular, through a decomposed interconnected graphical model, the registration similarity constraints are relaxed in the presence of change detection. Moreover, the deformation space is discretized, while efficient linear programming and duality principles are used to optimize a joint solution space where local consistency is imposed on the deformation and the detection space as well. The proposed formulation is able to operate in a fully unsupervised manner addressing binary change detection problems, i.e., change or no-change with respect to different similarity metrics. Furthermore, the framework has been formulated to address automatically the detection of from-to change trajectories under a supervised setting. Promising results on large scale experiments demonstrate the extreme potentials of our method.

Our approach models the inter- dependencies of variables through a higher order graph. The proposed formulation is modular with respect to the nature of images (various similarity metrics can be considered), the nature of deformations (arbitrary interpolation strategies), and the nature of segmentation likelihoods (various classification approaches can be employed). Inference of the proposed formulation is achieved through its mapping to an overparametrized pairwise graph which is then optimized using linear programming. Experimental results and the performed quantitative evaluation indicate the high potentials of the developed method.

    In this paper, a new method of unsupervised change detection is proposed by modeling multi-scale change detector based on local mixed information and we present a method of automated threshold. A theoretical analysis is presented to demonstrate that more comprehensive information is taken into account by the integration of multi-scale information. The ROC curves show that change detector based on multi-scale mixed information(MSM) is more effective than based on mixed information(MIX). Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets indicate that the multi-scale change detection of mixed information can eliminate the pseudo-change part of the area. Therefore, the proposed algorithm MSM is an effective method for the application of change detection.

    The new generation of Earth observation sensors with high spatial resolution can provide detailed information for change detection. The widely used methods for high-resolution image change detection rely on textural/structural features. However, these spatial features always produce high- dimensional data space since they are related to a series of parameters, e.g., window sizes and directions. Machine learning methods are also commonly employed, but their performances are subject to the quantity and quality of the training samples, and hence, much effort should be made to collect the high-quality samples. To address these problems, in this study, a novel multiindex automatic change detection method is proposed for the high-resolution imagery. The notable advantages of the proposed model include the following: 1) Complicated urban scenes are represented by a set of low dimensional but semantic information indexes, replacing the high- dimensional but low-level features (e.g., textural and structural features), and 2) the change detection model is carried out automatically without using training samples since the information indexes can directly indicate the primitive urban classes. The multiindex representation refers to the enhanced vegetation index, the water index, and the recently developed morphological building index. Experiments were conducted on the multitemporal WorldView-2 images over Shenzhen City (south of China) and Kuala Lumpur (the capital of Malaysia), where promising results were achieved by the proposed method. Moreover, the traditional methods based on the state-of-the-art textural/morphological features were also implemented for the purpose of comparison, which further validates the advantages of our proposed model.

    新一代高空间分辨率的地球观测传感器可以为变化探测提供详细的信息。应用广泛的高分辨率图像变化检测方法依赖于纹理/结构特征。然而，这些空间特征总是产生高维数据空间，因为它们与一系列参数有关，例如窗口大小和方向。机器学习方法也是常用的方法，但其性能受训练样本的数量和质量的影响，因此需要付出很大的努力来收集高质量的样本。针对这些问题，本文提出了一种新的高分辨率图像多指标自动变化检测方法。该模型包括以下的显著优势:1)复杂城市场景由一系列低维但语义信息索引,取代高——维但低级特性(例如,结构和结构特点),和2)变化检测模型进行自动不使用训练样本自信息索引可以直接显示原始城市类。多指标表示是指植被指数、水分指数和新近发展起来的形态建筑指数的增强。对深圳(中国南部)和吉隆坡(马来西亚首都)的多时相WorldView -2图像进行了实验，结果表明该方法是可行的。此外，我们亦采用传统的方法，以最先进的纹理/形态特征为基础进行比较，进一步验证我们所提出模型的优点。

    This study proposed a new framework that combines pixel-level change detection and object-level recognition to detect changes of built-up land from high-spatial resolution remote sensing images. First, an adaptive differencing method was designed to detect changes at the pixel level based on both spectral and textural features. Next, the changed pixels were subjected to a set of morphological operations to improve the completeness and to generate changed objects, achieving the transition of change detection from the pixel level to the object level. The changed objects were further recognised through the difference of morphological building index in two phases to indicate changed objects on built-up land. The transformation from changed pixels to changed objects makes the proposed framework distinct with both the pixel-based and the object-based change detection methods. Compared with the pixel-based methods, the proposed framework can improve the change detection capability through the transformation and successive recognition of objects. Compared with the object-based method, the proposed framework avoids the issue of multitemporal segmentation and can generate changed objects directly from changed pixels. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the transformation from changed pixels to changed objects and the successive object-based recognition on improving the detection accuracy, which justify the application potential of the proposed change detection framework.

    In order to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of the final change results, in this paper, we presented a hybrid change detection method based on combining pixel- and object-schemes, Firstly, the method obtained the orthogonal difference images using the pixel-based iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) algorithm, additionally in the process of iterative weighting, we applied the regularized scheme to stable the generalized characteristic equation for the multispectral data. Consequently, image segmentation algorithm was used to extract the image objects where the changes occurred. Finally, object-based classification method was applied to determinate the types of changes. In order to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach, a simple case was done by using the Horgos Port local multi-temporal and multispectral high-resolution image data in Xinjiang. Compared to the pixel-level IR-MAD, the experimental results showed that the overall accuracy has been improved, moreover successfully reduced noise and pseudo small changes in the final result.

    In remote sensing, conventional supervised change-detection methods usually require effective training data for multiple change types. This paper introduces a more flexible and efficient procedure that seeks to identify only the changes that users are interested in, here after referred to as "targeted change detection". Based on a one-class classifier "Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD)", a novel algorithm named "Three-layer SVDD Fusion (TLSF)" is developed specially for targeted change detection. The proposed algorithm combines one-class classification generated from change vector maps, as well as before and after-change images in order to get a more reliable detecting result. In addition, this paper introduces a detailed workflow for implementing this algorithm. This workflow has been applied to two case studies with different practical monitoring objectives: urban expansion and forest fire assessment. The experiment results of these two case studies show that the overall accuracy of our proposed algorithm is superior (Kappa statistics are 86.3% and 87.8% for Case 1 and 2, respectively), compared to applying SVDD to change vector analysis and post- classification comparison.

    Recently, a thresholding method based on the Rayleigh-Rice mixture has been proposed for solving binary change detection problems in multispectral image pairs. However, when images acquired by the last generation of multispectral scanners having high radiometric resolution are considered, the distribution fitting is still not satisfactory and computed thresholds remain quite distant from the optimal values. The main reason for this seems to be that in all previous approaches the unchange class is modeled as a single class. Instead, both practice and recent studies showed that this is not the case for new generation data. In this work, we propose a generalized statistical model for the difference image that allows the unchange class to be complex. The resulting model has more degrees of freedom, therefore it better fits real distributions and returns almost optimal thresholds for binary decision also with high radiometric resolution images.

    近年来，针对多光谱图像对中二值变化检测问题，提出了一种基于Rayleigh-Rice混合的阈值方法。然而，当考虑上一代高辐射分辨率多光谱扫描仪获取的图像时，分布拟合仍不理想，计算的阈值与最优值相差甚远。造成这种情况的主要原因似乎是，在所有以前的方法中，未变化类都被建模为单个类。相反，实践和最近的研究都表明，新一代数据并非如此。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个广义统计模型的差异图像，使不变类是复杂的。该模型具有较大的自由度，能够较好地拟合真实分布，并在高辐射分辨率图像的情况下，得到近似最优的二值决策阈值。

    An object oriented change detection algorithm for multi-temporal remote sensing image is proposed in this study. Bi-temporal remote sensing images are firstly processed by multi-scale segmentation. Then similarity between the target object and its neighboring object is calculated by using a formula of similarity calculation. Optimal threshold is selected by using K means clustering method to estimate whether the two images has similarity. Finally change between the target object and its neighboring object is determined by comparison of similarity and threshold. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can realize change detection of multi-temporal remote sensing image with high accuracy.

    Due to the noise interference and redundancy in multispectral images, it is promising to transform the available spectral channels into a suitable feature space for relieving noise and reducing the redundancy. The booming of deep learning provides a flexible tool to learn abstract and invariant
    features directly from the data in their raw forms. In this letter, we propose an unsupervised change detection technique for multispectral images, in which we combine deep belief networks (DBNs) and feature change analysis to highlight changes. First, a DBN is established to capture the key information for discrimination and suppress the irrelevant variations. Second, we map bitemporal change feature into a 2-D polar domain to characterize the change information. Finally, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is adopted to distinguish the changed and unchanged pixels, and then, the changed types can be identified by classifying the changed pixels into several classes according to the directions of feature changes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

    How to obtain accurate difference map remains an open challenge in change detection. To tackle this problem, we propose a change detection method based on saliency detection and wavelet transformation. We do frequency-tuned saliency detection in initial difference image (IDI) obtained by logarithm ratio to get a salient difference image (SDI). Then, we calculate local entropy of SDI to obtain an entropic salient difference image (ESDI). The final difference image (FDI) is the wavelet fusion of IDI and ESDI, and Otsu thresholding is used to extract difference map from FDI. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and feasibility.

    如何获得准确的差分图仍然是变化检测中一个有待解决的问题。针对这一问题，提出了一种基于显著性检测和小波变换的变化检测方法。对对数比得到的初始差分图像(IDI)进行频率调谐显著性检测，得到了一幅显著性差分图像(SDI)。然后，计算SDI的局部熵，得到一个熵显着差分图像(ESDI)。最后的差分图像(FDI)是IDI和ESDI的小波融合，利用Otsu阈值提取FDI的差分图。实验结果验证了该方法的有效性和可行性。

    For identification of change information, most studies focus on pixel-based techniques for low- resolution images, while few studies have examined object-based techniques for high-resolution images. Moreover, most of the techniques are complex and have a high requirement for the segmentation scale. This paper proposes a change detection method based on multi-sequence image objects and introduces the use of arithmetic progression to generate the set of segmentation scales. Pre-event and post-event images are segmented with multi-scales, respectively, and sub-objects are obtained based on the division of the minimum segmentation scales of bi-temporal images. Change feature vectors are constructed for each associated object of sub-object and vectors' magnitude is computed. After the determination of change threshold values, the change feature vectors are used to confirm whether sub-objects have changed, providing final change information. This method was tested using the bi-temporal WorldView-2 images taken before and after a landslide. The results confirm the feasibility of the method presented in this paper, and show its high accuracy through a comparison with the changing vector analysis method and the post-classification comparison method based on object-oriented theory. The approach outlined herein would be helpful for extraction of change information in high-resolution images.

    对于变化信息的识别，大多数研究集中在基于像素的低分辨率图像识别技术上，而很少有研究对基于对象的高分辨率图像识别技术进行研究。此外，这些技术大多比较复杂，对分割尺度要求较高。提出了一种基于多序列图像目标的变化检测方法，并介绍了利用等差数列生成分割尺度集的方法。分别对事件前和事件后的图像进行多尺度分割，根据双时相图像最小分割尺度的划分得到子目标。对每个子对象的关联对象构造变化特征向量，计算向量的大小。确定变化阈值后，利用变化特征向量确定子对象是否发生变化，提供最终的变化信息。利用滑坡前后的双时相WorldView-2图像对该方法进行了测试。结果验证了本文方法的可行性，并与基于面向对象理论的变化矢量分析法和后分类比较法进行了比较，表明该方法具有较高的精度。本文提出的方法将有助于高分辨率图像中变化信息的提取。

    Multi-spatial-resolution change detection is a newly proposed issue and it is of great significance in remote sensing, environmental and land use monitoring, etc. Though multi-spatial-resolution image pair are two kinds of representations of the same reality, they are often incommensurable superficially due to their different modalities and properties. In this paper, we present a novel multi- spatial resolution change detection framework, which incorporates deep-architecture-based unsupervised feature learning and mapping-based feature change analysis. Firstly, we transform multi-resolution image-pair into the same pixel-resolution through co-registration, followed by details recovery, which is designed to remedy the spatial details lost in the registration. Secondly, the denoising autoencoder is stacked to learn local and high-level representation/feature from the local neighborhood of the given pixel, in an unsupervised fashion. Thirdly, motivated by the fact that multi-resolution image-pair share the same reality in the unchanged regions, we try to explore the inner relationships between them by building a mapping neural network. And it can be used to learn a mapping function based on the most-unlikely-changed feature-pairs, which are selected from all the feature-pairs via a coarse initial change map generated in advance. The learned mapping function can bridge the different representations and highlight changes. Finally, we can build a robust and contractive change map through feature similarity analysis, and the change detection result is obtained through the segmentation of the final change map. Experiments are carried out on four real datasets, and the results confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

    多空间分辨率变化检测是近年来提出的一个新课题，在遥感、环境和土地利用监测等方面具有重要意义。虽然多空间分辨率图像对是同一现实的两种表现形式，但由于其形式和性质的不同，往往在表面上是不可通约性的。提出了一种基于深度体系结构的无监督特征学习和基于映射的特征变化分析的多空间分辨率变化检测框架。首先，通过共配准将多分辨率图像对转换为相同的像素分辨率，然后进行细节恢复，弥补配准过程中丢失的空间细节。其次，对去噪自编码器进行叠加，以无监督的方式从给定像素的局部邻域学习局部和高级表示/特征。第三，基于多分辨率图像对在不变区域内具有相同的真实感，我们尝试通过构建映射神经网络来探索它们之间的内在关系。它可以用来学习基于最不可能改变的特征对的映射函数，这些特征对是通过预先生成的粗初始变化图从所有特征对中选择出来的。所学习的映射函数可以桥接不同的表示并突出显示变化。最后，通过特征相似度分析，建立鲁棒性和收缩性的变化图，并对最终的变化图进行分割，得到变化检测结果。在四个实际数据集上进行了实验，结果验证了该方法的有效性和优越性。

    In this paper, a novel change detection method based on conditional random field (CRF) with region connection constraints in multitemporal high-resolution remote sensing images is proposed. The change detection problem is formulated as a labeling issue to discriminate the changed class from the unchanged class in the difference image. In the CRF model, the unary potential is described by using the memberships of unsupervised fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. The pairwise potential adopts a boundary constraint based on Euclidean distance. In addition, region iteration potential defined on a set of pixels is incorporated into CRF model to suppress the oversmooth performance. A chief advantage of our approach is to be able to achieve correct change map and avoid training a large number of model parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the change detection accuracy, is more robust against noise than other state-of-the-art approaches, and preserves boundary information.

    提出了一种基于带区域连接约束的条件随机场(CRF)变化检测方法。将变化检测问题表示为一个标签问题，用于区分不同图像中变化的类和未变化的类。在CRF模型中，利用无监督模糊c均值聚类算法的隶属度来描述一元势。双侧势采用基于欧氏距离的边界约束。此外，将一组像素上定义的区域迭代势引入CRF模型，抑制了超光滑性能。该方法的一个主要优点是能够实现正确的变化图，避免训练大量的模型参数。实验结果表明，该方法提高了变化检测的精度，对噪声具有较强的鲁棒性，同时保留了边界信息。

    The U.S. Geological Survey's Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative is a new end-to-end capability to continuously track and characterize changes in land cover, use, and condition to better support research and applications relevant to resource management and environmental change. Among the LCMAP product suite are annual land cover maps that will be available to the public. This paper describes an approach to optimize the selection of training and auxiliary data for deriving the thematic land cover maps based on all available clear observations from Landsats 4-8. Training data were selected from map products of the U.S. Geological Survey's Land Cover Trends project. The Random Forest classifier was applied for different classification scenarios based on the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We found that extracting training data proportionally to the occurrence of land cover classes was superior to an equal distribution of training data per class, and suggest using a total of 20,000 training pixels to classify an area about the size of a Landsat scene. The problem of unbalanced training data was alleviated by extracting a minimum of 600 training pixels and a maximum of 8000 training pixels per class. We additionally explored removing outliers contained within the training data based on their spectral and spatial criteria, but observed no significant improvement in classification results. We also tested the importance of different types of auxiliary data that were available for the conterminous United States, including: (a) five variables used by the National Land Cover Database, (b) three variables from the cloud screening "Function of mask" (Fmask) statistics, and (c) two variables from the change detection results of CCDC. We found that auxiliary variables such as a Digital Elevation Model and its derivatives (aspect, position index, and slope), potential wetland index, water probability, snow probability, and cloud probability improved the accuracy of land cover classification. Compared to the original strategy of the CCDC algorithm (500 pixels per class), the use of the optimal strategy improved the classification accuracies substantially (15- percentage point increase in overall accuracy and 4-percentage point increase in minimum accuracy).

    美国地质调查局的土地变化监测、评估和预测(LCMAP)计划是一项新的端到端能力，可以持续跟踪和描述土地覆盖、使用和条件的变化，从而更好地支持与资源管理和环境变化相关的研究和应用。在LCMAP的产品套件中，有年度土地覆盖图，将向公众提供。本文介绍了一种基于陆地卫星4-8上所有可用的清晰观测数据，优化选择训练数据和辅助数据来绘制专题土地覆盖图的方法。培训数据是从美国地质调查局土地覆盖趋势项目的地图产品中挑选出来的。基于连续变化检测与分类(CCDC)算法，将随机森林分类器应用于不同的分类场景。我们发现，按土地覆盖类的发生比例提取训练数据优于平均每个类的训练数据分布，建议使用总计20,000个训练像素对一个陆地卫星场景大小的区域进行分类。通过每节课最少提取600个训练像素，最多提取8000个训练像素，缓解了训练数据不平衡的问题。此外，我们还探索了基于训练数据的光谱和空间标准去除训练数据中包含的异常值，但没有发现分类结果有显著改善。我们还测试了不同类型的辅助数据的重要性在相接的美国,包括:(a)五个国家土地覆盖数据库所使用的变量,从云中(b)三个变量筛选”功能的面具”(Fmask)统计,和(c)两个变量变化检测结果的控烟条例。我们发现，数字高程模型及其导数(方面、位置指数、坡度)、潜在湿地指数、水概率、雪概率、云概率等辅助变量提高了土地覆被分类的准确性。与CCDC算法的原始策略(每个类500个像素)相比，使用最优策略大大提高了分类精度(总体精度提高15个百分点，最小精度提高4个百分点)。

    Change vector analysis (CVA) has been widely used in change detection of multitemporal multispectral images, whereas the use of a spectral angle mapper (SAM) is always ignored. CVA and SAM describe the difference from the perspective of vector magnitude and direction, respectively. Combining CVA and SAM can fully utilize the spectral vector and obtain a better change map. In this context, two strategies have been proposed: 1) a novel hybrid feature vector is constructed using a spectral angle and a change vector, which is utilized in SAM and CVA, respectively, and 2) a novel difference image is generated by using the autoadapted fusion strategy, which fuses the difference images acquired by utilizing CVA and SAM. During the fusion process, the autoadapted weight is defined by employing the entropy of the difference image. Experimental results on both simulated images and multitemporal multispectral images validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

    变化矢量分析(CVA)在多时间多光谱图像的变化检测中得到了广泛的应用，而谱角映射器(SAM)的使用却一直被忽略。CVA和SAM分别从矢量大小和方向来描述差异。结合CVA和SAM可以充分利用谱向量，得到较好的变化图。在这种背景下,提出了两种策略:1)一个新颖的混合特征向量构造使用光谱角和变化向量,利用在SAM和脑血管意外,分别生成和2)小说的差异图像通过使用自动更新融合策略,融合不同利用患者的影像资料和SAM。在融合过程中，利用差值图像的熵定义自适应权值。仿真图像和多光谱图像的实验结果验证了该方法的有效性。
