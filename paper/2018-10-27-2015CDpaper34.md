    Remote sensing is one of the most reliable ways to monitor land use and land cover change of large areas. On the other hand, satellite images from different agencies are becoming accessible due to the new user dissemination policies. For that reason, interpretation of remotely sensed data in a spatiotemporal context is becoming a valuable research topic. In the present day, a map of change has a great significant for scientific purposes or planning and management applications. However, it is difficult to extract useful visual information from the large collection of available satellite images. For that reason, automatic or semi-automatic exploration is needed. One of the key stages in the change detection methods is threshold selection. This threshold determination problem has been addressed by several recent techniques based on Change Vector Analysis (CVA). Thus, this work provides a simple semi-automatic procedure that defines the change/no change condition and a comparative study will be involved together with the previous existing method called Double Flexible Pace Search (DFPS). This study uses Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes acquired on different dates in an Algerian region. First, some training data sets containing all possible classes of change are required and their respective supervised posterior probability maps for each scene are obtained. The selected supervised classifier is based on the Maximum Likelihood method. Then four training sets (two sets from each date) are chosen from their corresponding probability maps based on their spatial location in the original images. The optimal average will be obtained as an average of the thresholds obtained at every set. This work verifies that the proposed approach is effective on the selected area, providing improved change map results.

    遥感是监测大面积土地利用和土地覆被变化最可靠的方法之一。另一方面，由于新的用户传播政策，来自不同机构的卫星图像正变得可以访问。因此，在时空背景下对遥感数据进行解释正成为一个有价值的研究课题。在今天，变化的地图对于科学目的或规划和管理应用具有重大意义。然而，从大量的可用卫星图像中提取有用的视觉信息是困难的。因此，需要自动或半自动勘探。阈值选择是变化检测方法的关键环节之一。基于变化向量分析(CVA)的一些最新技术已经解决了这个阈值确定问题。因此，这项工作提供了一个简单的半自动过程，定义了变化/没有变化的条件，并将与之前的现有方法称为双柔性步搜索(DFPS)进行比较研究。本研究使用了在阿尔及利亚地区不同日期获得的Landsat专题地图场景。首先，需要一些包含所有可能变化类别的训练数据集，并得到每个场景的各自监督后验概率图。所选的监督分类器基于极大似然法。然后根据原始图像的空间位置，从对应的概率图中选择4个训练集(每个日期2个训练集)。将得到的最优均值作为每组阈值的平均值，验证了该方法对所选区域的有效性，给出了改进的change map结果。

2.	Azzouzi S A, Vidal A, Bentounes H A. **A modified approach for change detection using change vector analysis in posterior probability space**[J]. The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 2015, 40(7): 593.

    The multispectral and multitemporal data coming from satellites allow us to extract valuable spatiotemporal change. Consequently, Earth surface change detection analysis has been used in the past to monitor land cover changes caused by different reasons. Several techniques have been used for that purpose and change vector analysis (CVA) has been frequently employed to carry out automatic spatiotemporal information extraction. This work describes a modified methodology based on Supervised Change Vector Analysis in Posterior probability Space (SCVAPS) with the final aim of obtaining a change detection map in Blida, Algeria. The proposed technique is a Modified version of Supervised Change Vector Analysis Posterior probability Space (MSCVAPS) and it is applied at the same region that the original technique studied in the literature. The classical Maximum Likelihood classifier is the selected method for supervised classification since it provides good properties in the posterior probability map. An improved method for threshold determination based on Double Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) is proposed in this work and it is employed to obtain the most adequate threshold value. Then, the MSCVAPS approach is evaluated by two cases study of the land cover change detection in the region of Blida, Algeria, and in the region of Shunyi District, Beijing, China, using a pair of Landsat Thematic Mapper images and pair of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper images, respectively. The final evaluation is given by the overall accuracy of changed and unchanged pixels and the kappa coefficient. The results show that the modified approach gives excellent results using the same area of study that was selected in the literature.

    来自卫星的多光谱和多时间数据使我们能够提取有价值的时空变化。因此，过去一直使用地表变化检测分析来监测由于不同原因引起的土地覆被变化。为此，人们采用了多种技术，并经常使用变化矢量分析(CVA)来实现时空信息的自动提取。本文提出了一种基于后验概率空间监督变化矢量分析的改进方法，最终获得阿尔及利亚布利达的变化检测图。该方法是监督变化矢量分析后验概率空间(MSCVAPS)的改进版本，与文献中研究的原始方法应用于同一区域。经典的最大似然分类器在后验概率图中具有良好的性能，是监督分类的首选方法。提出了一种改进的基于双柔步搜索的阈值确定方法，并利用该方法获得了最合适的阈值。然后，分别使用一对Landsat专题地图图像和一对Landsat增强专题地图图像，对MSCVAPS方法进行了阿尔及利亚Blida地区和中国北京顺义区土地覆被变化检测的两个案例研究。最后通过变化和未变化像素的总体精度和kappa系数进行评价。结果表明，改进后的方法与文献中选择的研究领域相同，取得了较好的结果。

Barazzetti L, Brumana R, Cuca B, et al. **Change detection from very high resolution satellite time series with variable off-nadir angle**[C]//Third International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy2015). International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2015, 9535: 953504.

    Very high resolution (VHR) satellite images have the potential for revealing changes occurred overtime with a superior level of detail. However, their use for metric purposes requires accurate geo-localization with ancillary DEMs and GCPs to achieve sub-pixel terrain correction, in order to obtain images useful for mapping applications. Change detection with a time series of VHS images is not a simple task because images acquired with different off-nadir angles have a lack of pixel-to- pixel image correspondence, even after accurate geo-correction. This paper presents a procedure for automatic change detection able to deal with variable off-nadir angles. The case study concerns the identification of damaged buildings from pre-and post-event images acquired on the historic center of L'Aquila (Italy), which was struck by an earthquake in April 2009. The developed procedure is a multi-step approach where (i) classes are assigned to both images via object-based classification,(ii) an initial alignment is provided with an automated tile-based rubber sheeting interpolation on the extracted layers, and (iii) change detection is carried out removing residual mis-registration issues resulting in elongated features close to building edges. The method is fully automated except for some thresholds that can be interactively set to improve the visualization of the damaged buildings. The experimental results proved that damages can be automatically found without additional information, such as digital surface models, SAR data, or thematic vector layers.

    高分辨率(VHR)卫星图像具有揭示随时间推移而发生的变化的潜力，具有更高的细节水平。然而，它们用于度量目的需要使用辅助DEMs和GCPs进行精确的地理定位，以实现亚像素地形校正，从而获得对地图应用有用的图像。利用VHS图像的时间序列进行变化检测并不是一项简单的任务，因为不同的离最低点角度获取的图像即使经过精确的地理校正，也缺乏像素与像素之间的图像对应关系。本文提出了一种能够自动检测变化的方法，该方法能够处理变化的离最低点角。该案例研究涉及从2009年4月发生地震的意大利拉奎拉历史中心获得的地震前后图像中识别受损建筑。开发过程是一个多步骤的方法,(我)类被分配到两个图像通过基于对象分类,(2)基于题目的初始对准是提供一个自动化的橡胶薄膜插值提取层,和(3)变化检测是进行消除残余mis-registration问题导致细长的特性接近建筑边缘。该方法是完全自动化的，除了一些阈值可以交互设置，以改善受损建筑物的可视化。实验结果表明，不需要额外的信息，如数字表面模型、SAR数据或主题向量层，就可以自动发现损伤。

    In this paper, we give a comparative study on three Multilayer Markov Random Field (MRF) based solutions proposed for change detection in optical remote sensing images, called Multicue MRF, Conditional Mixed Markov model, and Fusion MRF. Our purposes are twofold. On one hand, we highlight the significance of the focused model family and we set them against various state-of-the- art approaches through a thematic analysis and quantitative tests. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of class comparison vs. direct approaches, usage of training data, various targeted application fields and different ways of Ground Truth generation, meantime informing the Reader in which roles the Multilayer MRFs can be efficiently applied. On the other hand we also emphasize the differences between the three focused models at various levels, considering the model structures,feature extraction, layer interpretation, change concept definition, parameter tuning and performance. We provide qualitative and quantitative comparison results using principally a publicly available change detection database which contains aerial image pairs and Ground Truth change masks. We conclude that the discussed models are competitive against alternative state-of- the-art solutions, if one uses them as pre-processing filters in multitemporal optical image analysis. In addition, they cover together a large range of applications, considering the different usage options of the three approaches.

    本文对基于多层马尔可夫随机场(MRF)的多层 MRF、条件混合马尔可夫模型和融合MRF三种光学遥感图像变化检测方法进行了比较研究。我们的目的是双重的。一方面，我们强调了聚焦模型家族的重要性，并通过主题分析和定量测试，将其与各种最先进的方法进行对比。我们讨论了类比较与直接方法、训练数据的使用、各种目标应用领域和不同的地面真实感生成方法的优缺点，同时告诉读者如何有效地应用多层MRFs的角色。另一方面，从模型结构、特征提取、层解释、变化概念定义、参数调优和性能等方面，强调了三种模型在不同层次上的差异。我们提供定性和定量的比较结果，主要使用一个公开可用的变化检测数据库，其中包含航空图像对和地面真相变化掩码。我们的结论是，所讨论的模型是竞争性的替代国家的最先进的解决方案，如果使用他们作为预处理过滤器在多时间光学图像分析。此外，考虑到这三种方法的不同使用选项，它们涵盖了大量的应用。

5.	Bhatt, A., et al. (2015). **Automated Change Detection in Satellite Images Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Delhi, India**. 2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium: 1678-1681.

    In remote sensing, change detection is used in land use and cover analysis, forest or vegetation assessment and, flood monitoring. Although manual change detection is an option, the time required for it can be prohibitive. It is also highly subjective depending on the expertise of the analyst. Hence, the need for automated methods for such analysis tasks have emerged and thus gives rise to unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of the three types of unsupervised Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for change detection to detect the change in some of the dominant classes in an urban area, such as, vegetation, built-up and water bodies. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI imageries have been selected for a part of New Delhi and its nearby area. In this study, three indices namely Normalized Difference Builtup Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI(2)) have been generated from the Landsat data. Three algorithms, namely, K-Means, FCM and EM have been used, since these represent three different concepts in machine learning category i.e. partition based, fuzzy and probability based respectively. The same have been implemented in MATLAB for identifying different type of land cover over a period of 1998-2011. Considering both the intra-and inter-cluster distances, silhouette coefficients have been used for evaluation of cluster quality. The change is quantified in terms of percentage that depends upon the outcome of clustering and the number of pixel grouped in each class i.e. urban, vegetation and water.

    在遥感中，变化检测用于土地利用和覆盖分析、森林或植被评估以及洪水监测。虽然手动变化检测是一种选择，但是它所需的时间可能非常长。它也是高度主观的，这取决于分析师的专业知识。因此，对这类分析任务的自动化方法的需求已经出现，从而产生了无监督机器学习算法。本文分析了三种无监督机器学习(MLAs)变化检测算法的有效性，用于检测城市区域内植被、建筑物和水体等主导类的变化。landsat5 TM和landsat8 OLI图像已被选为新德里及其附近地区的一部分。本研究利用Landsat数据生成了归一化差分累积指数(NDBI)、修正归一化差分水分指数(MNDWI)和修正土壤调整植被指数(MSAVI(2))三个指标。使用了三种算法，即k均值、FCM和EM，因为它们分别代表了基于划分、基于模糊和基于概率的机器学习类别中的三个不同概念。在MATLAB中也实现了同样的方法，用于识别1998-2011年期间不同类型的土地覆盖。考虑到簇内距离和簇间距离，利用剪影系数对簇的质量进行了评价。这种变化可以用百分比来量化，百分比取决于聚类的结果和每个类别(城市、植被和水)中分组的像素数量。

6.	Byun, Y., et al. (2015). "**Image Fusion-Based Change Detection for Flood Extent Extraction Using Bi-Temporal Very High-Resolution Satellite Images**." Remote Sensing 7(8): 10347- 10363.

    Change detection based on satellite images acquired from an area at different dates is of widespread interest, according to the increasing number of flood-related disasters. The images help to generate products that support emergency response and flood management at a global scale. In this paper, a novel unsupervised change detection approach based on image fusion is introduced. The approach aims to extract the reliable flood extent from very high-resolution (VHR) bi-temporal images. The method takes an advantage of the spectral distortion that occurs during image fusion process to detect the change areas by flood. To this end, a change candidate image is extracted from the fused image generated with bi-temporal images by considering a local spectral distortion. This can be done by employing a universal image quality index (UIQI), which is a measure for local evaluation of spectral distortion. The decision threshold for the determination of changed pixels is set by applying a probability mixture model to the change candidate image based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We used bi-temporal KOMPSAT-2 satellite images to detect the flooded area in the city of N ' djamena in Chad. The performance of the proposed method was visually and quantitatively compared with existing change detection methods. The results showed that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy (OA = 75.04) close to that of the support vector machine (SVM)-based supervised change detection method. Moreover, the proposed method showed a better performance in differentiating the flooded area and the permanent water body compared to the existing change detection methods.

    随着与洪水有关的灾害日益增多，基于不同日期从某一地区获得的卫星图像进行变化检测具有广泛的意义。这些图像有助于生成支持全球范围的紧急响应和洪水管理的产品。提出了一种基于图像融合的无监督变化检测方法。该方法旨在从高分辨率(VHR)双时间图像中提取可靠的洪水范围。该方法利用图像融合过程中产生的光谱畸变来检测洪水变化区域。在此基础上，考虑局部光谱畸变，从双时间图像融合后的图像中提取变化候选图像。这可以通过使用通用图像质量指数(UIQI)来实现，UIQI是一种对光谱失真进行局部评估的方法。基于期望最大化(EM)算法，将概率混合模型应用于变化候选图像，设定了确定变化像素的决策阈值。我们使用KOMPSAT-2卫星图像探测乍得恩贾梅纳市的洪水区域。将该方法与现有的变化检测方法进行了可视化和定量比较。结果表明，该方法的总体精度(OA = 75.04)接近基于支持向量机(SVM)的监督变化检测方法。此外，与现有的变化检测方法相比，该方法在区分洪泛区和永久水体方面具有更好的性能。

    In many applications, such as image retrieval and change detection, we need to assess the similarity of two statistical models. As a distance measure between two probability density functions, Kullback-Leibler divergence is widely used for comparing two statistical models. Unfortunately, for some models such as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Kullback-Leibler divergence has no analytically tractable formula. We have to resort to approximation methods. In this paper, we compare seven methods, namely Monte Carlo method, matched bond approximation, product of Gaussian, variational method, unscented transformation, Gaussian approximation, and min- Gaussian approximation, for approximating the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two Gaussian mixture models for satellite image retrieval. Two image retrieval experiments based on two publicly available datasets have been performed. The comparison is carried out in terms of both retrieval performance and computational time.

    在许多应用中，如图像检索和变化检测，我们需要评估两个统计模型的相似性。作为两个概率密度函数之间的距离度量，Kullback-Leibler散度被广泛用于比较两个统计模型。遗憾的是，对于一些模型，如高斯混合模型(GMM)， Kullback-Leibler散度没有可分析的可处理公式。我们不得不求助于近似方法。摘要比较了蒙特卡罗方法、匹配键近似法、高斯积法、变分法、无迹变换、高斯逼近法和最小高斯逼近法等七种方法，以逼近两种高斯混合模型间的Kullback-Leibler散度。基于两个公开可用的数据集进行了两个图像检索实验。在检索性能和计算时间方面进行了比较。

    Change detection is by definition the capability to detect and highlight changes occurring in space and time. Earth Observation satellites represent a fundamental source of information thanks to repeatability in time and spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised change detection technique capable of processing a series of singledate built-up area extractions with two main goals: determining the age of different parts of an urban area and fixing errors due to the automatic extractions suggested in previous papers by our group. Results show a general stabilization of the Kappa value but further investigation is still necessary. The proposed algorithm is available to the general public as a part of a QGIS plugin named SENSUM Earth Observation (EO) tools.

    根据定义，变化检测是检测和突出发生在空间和时间中的变化的能力。由于时间和空间分辨率的重复性，地球观测卫星是一个基本的信息来源。在本文中，我们提出了一种无监督的变化检测技术，能够处理一系列单日期的建成区提取，其主要目标有两个:确定城市区域不同部分的年龄，以及修复我们之前的论文中提出的自动提取的错误。结果表明，Kappa值总体稳定，但仍需进一步研究。该算法作为一个名为SENSUM Earth Observation (EO) tools的QGIS插件的一部分提供给公众。

9.	Ding, K., et al. (2015). "**Sparse Hierarchical Clustering for VHR Image Change Detection**." IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters 12(3): 577-581.

    The traditional clustering approaches are limited for the unsupervised change detection of very high resolution images due to the multimodal distribution of change features. To overcome this difficulty, a sparse hierarchical clustering approach is proposed. Discriminative change features are generated by stacking bitemporal multiscale center-symmetric local binary pattern features. In order to explore the multimodal and hierarchical distribution of the change features, a tree-structured dictionary is learned from the pseudotraining set and the unlabeled data. The sparse reconstruction error, a more robust distance compared to the Euclidean distance, is used to determine the label of each change feature. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    由于变化特征的多模态分布，传统的聚类方法对高分辨率图像的无监督变化检测存在一定的局限性。为了克服这一困难，提出了一种稀疏层次聚类方法。通过叠加双中心对称的局部二值模式特征，产生了判别变化特征。为了研究变化特征的多模态和层次分布，从伪训练集和未标记数据中学习了一个树结构字典。利用稀疏重建误差(相对于欧氏距离更鲁棒的距离)确定每个变化特征的标签。对比实验证明了该方法的有效性。

    Multispectral images of very high spatial resolution and vector data from geospatial databases, such as cadastral maps, are among the cost-effective and broadly available geodata in urban environments. Therefore, we aim to address building change detection based on pre-existing building footprint information and a single yew high resolution multispectral image. An object-based classification methodology was developed that employs advanced scale-space filtering, unsupervised clustering, and knowledge-based classification. The developed framework effectively integrates prior vector data and multispectral observations, through incorporating the prior knowledge into the training process and defining the proper object-based classification rules. The methodology successfully identified important building changes, which were validated by employing the vector information of a building geodatabase and a QuickBird image acquired in 2003 and 2007, respectively, over urban regions in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The performed quantitative and qualitative evaluation indicated that the proposed analysis framework can detect the new buildings with high accuracy rates and, to a lesser degree, their exact shape and size.

    来自地籍图等地理空间数据库的高空间分辨率多光谱图像和矢量数据是城市环境中具有成本效益和广泛可用的地理数据之一。因此，我们的目标是解决基于现有的建筑足迹信息和单紫杉高分辨率多光谱图像的建筑变化检测。提出了一种基于对象的分类方法，该方法采用了先进的尺度空间滤波、无监督聚类和基于知识的分类方法。该框架通过将先验知识融入训练过程，定义合适的基于对象的分类规则，有效地集成了先验向量数据和多光谱观测。该方法成功地识别了重要的建筑变化，并通过分别在2003年和2007年获得的希腊塞萨洛尼基城市地区的建筑地理数据库矢量信息和QuickBird图像进行了验证。定量和定性评价表明，所提出的分析框架能够较高精度地检测出新建筑，并在较小程度上准确地检测出其形状和尺寸。 

11.	Han M, Zhou Y. **Joint-classification change detection based on improved fuzzy ARTMAP**[C]//2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS). IEEE, 2015: 346-349.

    Post-Classification Comparison(PCC) method is widely used in change detection for remote sensing images, but it is affected by a significant cumulative error caused by single remote sensing image classification during change detection, which leads to the excessive evaluation of changed types and quantity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change detection method for remote sensing images based on Adaptive Resonance Theory Mapping (ARTMAP) neural network. Similarity matrix is constructed by spectral feature vectors. Then the threshold value of similarity is obtained, which is used to control the joint-classification classifier based on the ARTMAP neural network. In addition, an adaptive algorithm of vigilance parameter is introduced to the classification process of fuzzy ARTMAP neural network. The experimental results obtained on remote sensing images show that the proposed method not only accurately classifies the unchanged geographical information in different temporal images into the same class, but also reduces the cumulative error and improves the accuracy of change detection compared with other methods.

    后分类比较(PCC)方法在遥感图像变化检测中得到了广泛的应用，但在变化检测过程中受到单一遥感图像分类产生的显著累积误差的影响，导致对变化类型和数量的评价过高。针对这一问题，提出了一种基于自适应共振理论映射(ARTMAP)神经网络的遥感图像变化检测方法。利用谱特征向量构造相似矩阵。然后得到相似度阈值，用于控制基于ARTMAP神经网络的联合分类器。此外，将自适应的警戒参数算法引入模糊ARTMAP神经网络的分类过程。对遥感图像的实验结果表明，与其他方法相比，该方法不仅能准确地将不同时间图像中未变化的地理信息分类为同一类，而且减少了累积误差，提高了变化检测的精度。

12.	Han, Y., et al. (2015). "**An Approach to Fine Coregistration Between Very High Resolution Multispectral Images Based on Registration Noise Distribution**." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 53(12): 6650-6662.

    Even after applying effective coregistration methods, multitemporal images are likely to show a residual misalignment, which is referred to as registration noise (RN). This is because coregistration methods from the literature cannot fully handle the local dissimilarities induced by differences in the acquisition conditions (e.g., the stability of the acquisition platform, the off-nadir angle of the sensor, the structure of the considered scene, etc.). This paper addresses the problem of reducing such a residual misalignment by proposing a fine automatic coregistration approach for very high resolution (VHR) multispectral images. The proposed method takes advantage of the properties of the residual misalignment itself. To this end, RN is first extracted in the change vector analysis (CVA) polar domain according to the behaviors of the specific multitemporal images considered. Then, a local analysis of RN pixels (i.e., those showing residual misalignment) is conducted for automatically extracting control points (CPs) and matching them according to their estimated displacement. Matched CPs are used for generating a deformation map by interpolation. Finally, one VHR image is warped to the coordinates of the other through a deformation map. Experiments carried out on simulated and real multitemporal VHR images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
    
    即使应用了有效的共配准方法，多时间图像仍有可能出现残留的配准误差，即配准噪声(RN)。这是因为文献中的共配准方法不能完全处理由于采集条件的不同而引起的局部差异(如采集平台的稳定性、传感器的离底角、被考虑场景的结构等)。本文提出了一种高分辨率(VHR)多光谱图像的精细自动配准方法，解决了如何减少这种残留配准误差的问题。该方法利用了残差失调本身的特点。为此，首先根据所考虑的特定多时间图像的行为，在变化矢量分析(CVA)极域中提取RN。然后，对RN像素进行局部分析(即，对存在残差的控制点进行自动提取，并根据估计的位移进行匹配。匹配的CPs用于插值生成变形图。最后，通过变形图将一幅VHR图像扭曲到另一幅VHR图像的坐标。对仿真和真实的多时间VHR图像进行了实验，验证了该方法的有效性。

    This study proposes an approach to unsupervised change detection in which two different change maps are fused using different trade-off parameters of an active contour model. First, the change vector analysis method is conducted to produce a difference image from multitemporal and multispectral remotely sensed images. Second, two change maps are obtained based on the difference image using an active contour model using two different values of the trade-off parameter. Finally, an advantage fusion strategy is proposed to yield a final change map by fusing the two change maps, thereby reducing false alarms and preserving the accurate outlines of the changed regions. Two experiments are conducted with Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach vis-a-vis some of the state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to the reduction of the effect of the trade-off parameter on the accuracy of the change map.

    本文提出了一种无监督变化检测方法，利用活动轮廓模型的不同权衡参数融合两种不同的变化图。首先，采用变化矢量分析方法，从多时间、多光谱遥感图像中生成差分图像。其次，利用两种不同的权衡参数值，利用活动轮廓模型得到两幅基于差分图像的变化图。最后，提出了一种优势融合策略，通过融合两个变化图得到最终的变化图，从而减少了误报，保持了变化区域的准确轮廓。利用Landsat-7增强型专题图器Plus和Landsat-5专题图器数据集进行了两个实验，评价了该方法的性能。结果证实了所提出的方法相对于一些最先进的方法的有效性。这一工作有助于减少权衡参数对变化图精度的影响。

14.	He, P. F., et al. (2015). "**Advanced Markov random field model based on local uncertainty for unsupervised change detection**." Remote Sensing Letters 6(9): 667-676.

    Markov random field (MRF)-based methods are effective and popular unsupervised methods for detecting changes in remotely sensed images. In this method, the spatial contextual information is well utilized to conquer the problem of noise sensitivity in the pixel-wise change detection methods. Meanwhile, MRF also suffers from the over-smooth problem and the hard balance between denoising and detail preserving. To tackle these limitations, this letter presented an advanced MRF model based on local uncertainty (LUMRF). First, fuzzy c-means (FCM) cluster method is applied to the difference image obtained by change vector analysis to character each pixel with an initial label (change or no-change) and the corresponding membership values. To improve the detail preservation ability of MRF, the local uncertainty in a given window is subsequently computed and then integrated in the spatial energy term of MRF model. Finally, a refined change map is produced by the proposed LUMRF method. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that, in comparison to FCM and MRF, LUMRF gives a better performance with the lowest total error detection and the performance is more robust to the parameter changes.

    基于马尔可夫随机场(MRF)的方法是遥感图像变化检测的一种有效且流行的无监督方法。该方法充分利用空间上下文信息，克服了像素变化检测方法中存在的噪声敏感问题。同时，MRF也存在着过于平滑的问题，难以在去噪和细节保留之间取得平衡。为了解决这些局限性，本文提出了一种基于局部不确定性(LUMRF)的先进MRF模型。首先，将模糊c均值聚类方法应用于变化向量分析得到的差分图像中，对每个像素进行初始标记(变化或不变化)和相应的隶属度值进行字符划分。为了提高MRF的细节保存能力，计算了给定窗口的局部不确定性，并将其集成到MRF模型的空间能量项中。最后，利用所提出的LUMRF方法生成了一个精细的变化图。通过两个实验验证了该方法的有效性。结果表明，与FCM和MRF相比，LUMRF具有更好的性能，总误差检测最低，对参数变化的鲁棒性更强。


15.	Hoberg, T., et al. (2015). "**Conditional Random Fields for Multitemporal and Multiscale Classification of Optical Satellite Imagery**." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 53(2): 659-673.

    In this paper, we present a method for the multitemporal and contextual classification of georeferenced optical remote sensing images acquired at different epochs and having different geometrical resolutions. The method is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for contextual classification. The CRF model is expanded by temporal interaction terms that link neighboring epochs via transition probabilities between different classes. In order to be able to deal with data of different resolution, the class structure at different epochs may vary with the resolution. The goal of the multitemporal classification is an improved classification performance at all individual epochs, but also the detection of land-cover changes, possibly using lower resolution data. This paper also contains a comparison of the performance of different models for the interaction potentials. Results are given for two different test sites in Germany, where Ikonos, RapidEye, and Landsat images are available. Our results show that the multitemporal classification does indeed increase the overall accuracy of all epochs compared to a monotemporal classification and to a state-of-the-art multitemporal classification method, and that it is feasible to detect changes in lower resolution images.

    本文提出了一种对不同时代、不同几何分辨率的光学遥感影像进行多时间和上下文分类的方法。该方法基于条件随机域(CRFs)进行上下文分类。CRF模型由时间相互作用项扩展而成，时间相互作用项通过不同类别间的转移概率将相邻的时代联系起来。为了能够处理不同分辨率的数据，不同时代的类结构可能会随着分辨率的不同而变化。多时间分类的目标是在所有单独的时间点提高分类性能，但也可以检测土地覆盖变化，可能使用的分辨率较低的数据。本文还对不同模型的交互势性能进行了比较。结果给出了两个不同的测试地点在德国，在那里Ikonos, RapidEye和Landsat图像是可用的。结果表明，与单时间分类和最先进的多时间分类方法相比，多时间分类确实提高了所有时间点的总体精度，并且对低分辨率图像的变化检测是可行的。

    This paper presents a novel approach for urban change detection of high resolution (HR) remote sensing images. To overcome deficiency of traditional pixel-based methods and better annotate HR images, object-based strategies are adopted. Firstly change vector analysis (CVA) and local binary patterns (LBP) are utilized to extract the object-specific features based on the image-objects acquired by multitemporal segmentation. Then sparse representation is further exploited to characterize highly effective sparse features. Finally, the final change map is obtained by support vector machine (SVM) with the pseudotraining set acquired by expectation maximization (EM). Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    In this paper, a novel algorithm for unsupervised change detection in multitemporal multispectral images of the same scene using parallel binary particle swarm optimization (PBPSO) is proposed. The algorithm operates on a difference image, which is created by using a novel fusion algorithm on multitemporal multispectral images, by iteratively minimizing a cost function with PBPSO to produce a final binary change-detection mask representing changed and unchanged pixels. Each BPSO of parallel instances is run on a separate processor and initialized with a different starting population representing a set of change-detection masks. A communication strategy is applied to transmit data in between BPSOs running in parallel. The algorithm takes the full advantage of parallel processing to improve both the convergence rate and detection performance. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method by quantitative and qualitative tests on semisynthetic and real-world data sets. The semisynthetic results for different levels of Gaussian noise are obtained in terms of false and miss alarm (MA) rates between the estimated change- detection mask and the ground truth image. The proposed method on the semisynthetic data with high level of Gaussian noise obtains the final change-detection mask with a false error rate of 1.50 and MA error rate of 14.51.

    提出了一种基于并行二值粒子群优化(PBPSO)的无监督变化检测算法。该算法对一幅差分图像进行处理，该图像采用一种新的多时间多光谱图像融合算法，利用PBPSO迭代最小化代价函数，生成一个表示变化和不变像素的最终二进制变化检测掩码。并行实例的每个BPSO在单独的处理器上运行，并使用表示一组变化检测掩码的不同初始填充初始化。采用通信策略在并行运行的BPSOs之间传输数据。该算法充分利用了并行处理的优点，提高了算法的收敛速度和检测性能。通过对半合成和真实数据集的定量和定性测试，验证了该方法的准确性。根据估计的变化检测掩模与地面真实图像之间的误报率和漏报率，得到了不同高斯噪声水平下的半合成结果。该方法在高高斯噪声的半合成数据上得到了最终的变化检测mask，错误率为1.50,MA错误率为14.51。

    In this paper a novel object-oriented change detection approach in multitemporal remote-sensing images is proposed. In order to improve post classification comparison (PCC) performance, we propose to exploit spatiotemporal relationship between two images acquired at two different times. The probabilities of class transitions are used to describe the temporal dependence information, while the Markov Random Field (MRF) model is utilized to represent the spatial-contextual information. Training sets are required to get initial classification results by maximum likelihood method (ML). Then an estimation procedure: iterated conditional mode (ICM) is present to revise the classification results. Change detection (change/no change) and change type recognitions (from- to types of change) are achieved by compare classification maps acquired at two different times. Experimental results on two QuickBird images confirm that the proposed method can provide higher accuracy than the PCC method, which ignores spatiotemporal relationship between two images.

    提出了一种面向对象的多时间遥感图像变化检测方法。为了提高后分类比较(PCC)的性能，我们提出利用两个不同时间获得的图像之间的时空关系。利用类转移概率描述时间依赖信息，利用马尔可夫随机场模型表示空间上下文信息。采用最大似然法(ML)得到初始分类结果需要训练集。然后，提出了一种迭代条件模式(ICM)对分类结果进行修正的估计方法。变化检测(变化/无变化)和变化类型识别(从-到变化类型)是通过比较两次不同时间获得的分类图来实现的。对两幅QuickBird图像的实验结果表明，该方法比PCC方法具有更高的精度，忽略了两幅图像之间的时空关系。

    In change detection analysis, it is important to distinguish the real change targets and pseudo change targets accurately. Supervised change detection has been regarded as the best way to reduce the effects of pseudo change information. This is because human visual system has the ability to find the real changes. By imitating human visual characteristic, visual attention mechanism can bring the improvement of accuracy and speed of unsupervised change detection. In this paper, a change detection approach based on visual attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the influence of pseudo change information. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly reduces the false alarm rate and missed alarm rate and also shows insensitive to noise.

    在变化检测分析中，准确区分真实的变化目标和伪变化目标是非常重要的。监督变化检测被认为是减少伪变化信息影响的最佳方法。这是因为人类的视觉系统有能力发现真正的变化。通过模仿人的视觉特征，视觉注意机制可以提高无监督变化检测的准确性和速度。本文提出了一种基于视觉注意机制的变化检测方法，以减小伪变化信息的影响。实验表明，该方法显著降低了误报率和漏报率，且对噪声不敏感。

    With the unprecedented growth of urban population and urban development, we are faced with the growing trend of illegal building (IB) construction. Field visit, as the currently used method of IB detection, is time and man power consuming, in addition to its high cost. Therefore, an automatic IB detection is required. Acquiring multi-temporal satellite images and using image processing techniques for automatic change detection is one of the optimum methods which can be used in IB monitoring. In this research an automatic method of IB detection has been proposed. Two-temporal panchromatic satellite images of IRS-P5 of the study area in a part of Tehran, the city map and an updated spatial database of existing buildings were used to detect the suspected IBs. In the preprocessing step, the images were geometrically and radiometrically corrected. In the next step, the changed pixels were detected using K-means clustering technique because of its quickness and less user's intervention required. Then, all the changed pixels of each building were identified and the change percentage of each building with the standard threshold of changes was compared to detect the buildings which are under construction. Finally, the IBs were detected by checking the municipality database. The unmatched constructed buildings with municipal database will be field checked to identify the IBs. The results show that out of 343 buildings appeared in the images; only 19 buildings were detected as under construction and three of them as unlicensed buildings. Furthermore, the overall accuracies of 83%, 79% and 75% were obtained for K-means change detection, detection of under construction buildings and IBs detection, respectively.

    随着城市人口的空前增长和城市的发展，我们面临着非法建筑(IB)的增长趋势。实地考察作为目前IB检测的一种方法，不仅成本高，而且耗时耗力。因此，需要一个自动的IB检测。获取多时间卫星图像，利用图像处理技术进行自动变化检测，是实现IB监测的最优方法之一。本文提出了一种自动检测IB的方法。德黑兰部分研究区IRS-P5的双时间全色卫星图像、城市地图和更新的现有建筑空间数据库被用于检测可疑的IBs。在预处理阶段，对图像进行几何校正和放射学校正。下一步，利用k -均值聚类技术快速检测出变化的像素点，减少了用户的干预。然后，对每个建筑的所有变化像素进行识别，并将每个建筑的变化百分比与标准变化阈值进行比较，以检测正在建设的建筑。最后，通过对市政数据库的检测，发现了IBs。与城市数据库不匹配的建筑将被实地检查，以确定IBs。结果表明，343座建筑中出现在图像中;只检出19幢正在兴建的楼宇，其中3幢为无牌楼宇。此外，k均值变化检测、在建建筑检测和IBs检测的总体准确率分别为83%、79%和75%。

    The utility of land-cover change data is often derived from the intersection with other information, such as riparian buffers zones or other areas of conservation concern. In order to avoid error propagation, we wanted to optimize our change maps to have very low error rates. Our accuracy optimization methods doubled the number of total change locations mapped, and also increased the area of development related mapped change by 93%. The ratio of mapped to estimated change was increased from 76.3% to 86.6%. To achieve this, we used object-based change detection to assign a probability of change for each landscape unit derived from two dates of 1 m US National Agriculture Imagery Program data. We developed a rapid assessment tool to reduce analyst review time such that thousands of locations can be reviewed per day. We reviewed all change locations with probabilities above a series of thresholds to assess commission errors and the relative cost of decreasing acceptance thresholds. The resultant change maps had only change locations verified to be changed, thus eliminating commission error. This tool facilitated efficient development of large training sets in addition to greatly reducing the effort required to manually verify all predicted change locations. The efficiency gain allowed us to review locations with less than a 50% probability of change without inflating commission errors and, thus, increased our change detection rates while eliminating both commission errors and locations that would have been omission errors among the reviewed lower probability change locations.

    土地覆盖变化数据的效用往往来自与其他信息的交集，例如河岸缓冲区或其他养护关注领域。为了避免错误传播，我们希望优化我们的变化图，使其错误率非常低。我们的精度优化方法将图的总变化位置增加了一倍，并且将与开发相关的图变化区域增加了93%。反映变化与估计变化的比率从76.3%提高到86.6%。为了实现这一目标，我们使用基于对象的变化检测来为每个景观单元分配一个变化概率，该概率来自美国国家农业图像项目数据的两个日期。我们开发了一个快速评估工具，以减少分析师的审查时间，这样每天可以审查数千个地点。我们回顾了所有发生变化的位置，这些位置的概率都高于一系列阈值，以评估佣金误差和降低接受阈值的相对成本。所得到的变化地图只验证要变化的变化位置，从而消除了委托错误。这个工具除了大大减少手工验证所有预测变化位置所需的工作之外，还促进了大型培训集的高效开发。效率的提高使我们能够在不增加佣金错误的情况下检查变化概率低于50%的位置，从而提高了我们的变化检出率，同时消除了佣金错误和被检查的较低概率变化位置中可能被遗漏的位置。

    In this paper, in order to detect changes in high resolution remote sensing images, we propose an MRF-based change detection method combined with the semantic information. Two temporal high resolution remote sensing images are represented by features of superpixels. For given images, we transform the change detection problem into a binary classification problem by combining differences in both low-level features and semantic information in MRF smoothing framework. All pixels are divided into two categories: changed or unchanged, so we can extract change information from classification result. Experimental results of two Geo-Eye1 high-resolution remote sensing images at different time demonstrate the efficiency of this proposed method. Detection combined with semantic information can significantly improve the result than only with low-level features. Adding Markov smoothing can also improve the detection results slightly.

    为了检测高分辨率遥感图像的变化，提出了一种结合语义信息的基于mrf的变化检测方法。利用超像素特征表示两幅高分辨率遥感图像。针对给定的图像，将MRF平滑框架中低层特征和语义信息的差异结合起来，将变化检测问题转化为二分类问题。所有的像素都分为两类:变化的和未变化的，这样我们就可以从分类结果中提取变化信息。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。结合语义信息的检测比仅结合低层特征的检测结果有显著提高。添加马尔可夫平滑也可以稍微改善检测结果。

    This paper addresses the problem of change detection from very high resolution remotely sensed images and its application on road damage extraction in case of major disaster. The proposed methodology is based on the multiscale image segmentation using the Haar wavelet in order to define the appropriate unit of analysis for the comparison step. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is then applied as a similarity measurement to identify changed regions. This strategy is adapted to solve the road damage extraction problem by applying the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). The images acquired during the earthquake that hits Port-au-Prince (Haiti) on 12 January 2010 are used in the experimentations and the obtained results demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the described method.

    In the event of a natural disaster, such as a flood or earthquake, using fast and efficient methods for estimating the extent of the damage is critical. Automatic change mapping and estimating are important in order to monitor environmental changes, e.g., deforestation. Traditional change detection (CD) approaches are time consuming, user dependent, and strongly influenced by noise and/or complex spectral classes in a region. Change maps obtained by these methods usually suffer from isolated changed pixels and have low accuracy. To deal with this, an automatic CD framework- which is based on the integration of change vector analysis (CVA) technique, kernel-based C-means clustering (KCMC), and kernel-based minimum distance (KBMD) classifier-is proposed. In parallel with the proposed algorithm, a support vector machine (SVM) CD method is presented and analyzed. In the first step, a differential image is generated via two approaches in high dimensional Hilbert space. Next, by using CVA and automatically determining a threshold, the pseudo-training samples of the change and no-change classes are extracted. These training samples are used for determining the initial value of KCMC parameters and training the SVM-based CD method. Then optimizing a cost function with the nature of geometrical and spectral similarity in the kernel space is employed in order to estimate the KCMC parameters and to select the precise training samples. These training samples are used to train the KBMD classifier. Last, the class label of each unknown pixel is determined using the KBMD classifier and SVM-based CD method. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for various remote sensing images and applications, two different datasets acquired by Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ are used. The results show a good flexibility and effectiveness of this automatic CD method for environmental change monitoring. In addition, the comparative analysis of results from the proposed method (O. A.: 95.75, kappa: 0.91) and the classical CD techniques, namely, the principal component analysis-based CD method [overall accuracy (O. A.): 69.41, kappa: 0.55], the independent component analysis-based CD method (O. A.: 85.48, kappa: 0.68), spectral angle mapper (O. A.: 75.38, kappa: 0.60), image subtraction CD (O. A.: 86.57, kappa: 0.69), and image rationing CD (O. A.: 76.45, kappa: 0.61) methods shows that the accuracy of the obtained change map can be considerably improved. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based CD methods do not depend on the instrument or the nature of change classes. 

    在发生自然灾害时，例如洪水或地震，使用快速和有效的方法来估计破坏的程度是至关重要的。为了监测环境变化，例如森林砍伐，自动变化地图和估计是很重要的。传统的变化检测(CD)方法费时、依赖于用户，并且受噪声和/或区域内的复杂光谱类的强烈影响。这些方法得到的变化图往往是孤立的变化像素，精度较低。为此，提出了一种基于变化矢量分析(CVA)技术、基于核均值聚类(KCMC)和基于核最小距离(KBMD)分类器的自动CD框架。在此基础上，提出并分析了一种支持向量机CD算法。第一步是在高维希尔伯特空间中通过两种方法生成差分图像。然后，利用CVA自动确定阈值，提取出变化类和不变化类的伪训练样本。这些训练样本用于确定KCMC参数的初值，并训练基于svm的CD方法。然后利用核空间中具有几何相似性和谱相似性的代价函数进行优化，估计KCMC参数，选择精确的训练样本。这些训练样本用于训练KBMD分类器。最后，利用KBMD分类器和基于svm的CD方法确定每个未知像素的类标签。为了评估该算法在各种遥感图像和应用中的效率，使用了Quickbird和Landsat TM/ETM+获取的两个不同的数据集。结果表明，该方法具有良好的灵活性和有效性。此外，对所提方法的结果进行了比较分析。: 95.75, kappa: 0.91)和经典的CD技术，即基于主成分分析的CD方法[总精度(O.

    Detection of damages caused by natural disasters is a delicate and difficult task due to the time constraints imposed by emergency situations. Therefore, an automatic Change Detection (CD) algorithm, with less user interaction, is always very interesting and helpful. So far, there is no existing CD approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) multi-temporal images being corrupted by either noise or non-normalized radiometric differences; (c) difference images having overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other. Also, a low degree of automation is not optimal for real- time CD applications and also one-dimensional representations of classical CD methods hide the useful information in multi-temporal images. In order to resolve these problems, two automatic kernel-based CD algorithms (KCD) were proposed based on kernel clustering and support vector data description (SVDD) algorithms in high dimensional Hilbert space. In this paper (a( a new similarity space was proposed in order to increase the separation between change and no-change classes, and also to decrease the processing time, (b) three kernel-based approaches were proposed for transferring the multi-temporal images from spectral space into high dimensional Hilbert space,(c) automatic approach was proposed to extract the precise labeled samples; (d) kernel parameter was selected automatically by optimizing an improved cost function and (e) initial value of the kernel parameter was estimated by a statistical method based on the L2-norm distance. Two different datasets including Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were used for the accuracy of analysis of proposed methods. The comparative analysis showed the accuracy improvements of kernel clustering based CD and SVDD based CD methods with respect to the conventional CD techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction, Independent Component Analysis, Spectral Angle Mapper, Simple Image differencing and Image Rationing, and also the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of the proposed CD method in similarity space decreases the processing runtime.

    由于紧急情况造成的时间限制，查明自然灾害造成的损害是一项微妙和困难的任务。因此，一种用户交互较少的自动变化检测(CD)算法总是非常有趣和有用。到目前为止，对于(a)研究区域内不存在贴有标签的样本，没有一种现有的CD方法是最优和适用的;(b)受噪声或非归一化辐射差影响的多时期图像;(c)具有重叠变化的差分图像和相互之间非线性可分的无变化类的差分图像。同时，低自动化程度对实时CD应用不是最优的，经典CD方法的一维表示将有用信息隐藏在多时间图像中。为了解决这些问题，提出了两种基于核聚类和支持向量数据描述(SVDD)的高维希尔伯特空间自动核CD算法。摘要((提出了一种新的相似度空间为了增加变化和与类之间的分离,减少处理时间,(b)提出了三种基于内核的方法将时段遥测图像从光谱空间到高维希尔伯特空间,(c)方法,提出了自动提取精确的标记样本;(d)通过优化改进的代价函数自动选择核参数，(e)采用基于l2 -范数距离的统计方法估计核参数的初值。使用Quickbird和Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries两种不同的数据集对提出的方法进行了精度分析。比较分析显示精度的改进的基于核聚类CD和SVDD CD方法对传统的光盘技术,如噪音最低分数,独立分量分析、光谱角制图者,简单的图像差分和图像定量配给,并计算成本分析表明,拟议中的CD方法的实现在相似的空间减少了处理运行时。

    In this paper we introduce an object-based change detection model using correlation analysis and classification. First we use eCognition to obtain an over-segmentation map. Then linear regression is used to gain three unique types of parameters-regression coefficient, offset, and correlation coefficient which can provide valuable information about the location and numeric change value derived within the segmentation objects in the two data sets. Understandably, the two data tend to be highly correlated when little change occurs, and uncorrelated when change occurs. Then we treat the three variables as a three-band image. Finally, we perform maximum likelihood classification with training examples. The result shows that our method performs better than the methods proposed by Yang [2] and J. Im [3]. The advantages of our method are that it performs automatically without selecting threshold empirically and alleviates the "salt and pepper" effect.

    Canonical correlation analysis is an established multivariate statistical method in which correlation between linear combinations of multivariate sets of variables is maximized. In canonical information analysis introduced here, linear correlation as a measure of association between variables is replaced by the information theoretical, entropy based measure mutual information, which is a much more general measure of association. We make canonical information analysis feasible for large sample problems, including for example multispectral images, due to the use of a fast kernel density estimator for entropy estimation. Canonical information analysis is applied successfully to (1) simple simulated data to illustrate the basic idea and evaluate performance, (2) fusion of weather radar and optical geostationary satellite data in a situation with heavy precipitation, and (3) change detection in optical airborne data. The simulation study shows that canonical information analysis is as accurate as and much faster than algorithms presented in previous work, especially for large sample sizes.

    In this paper we present an approach to perform relative spectral alignment between optical cross- sensor acquisitions. The proposed method aims at projecting the images from two different and possibly disjoint input spaces into a common latent space, in which standard change detection algorithms can be applied. The system relies on the regularized kernel canonical correlation analysis transformation (kCCA), which can accommodate nonlinear dependencies between pixels by means of kernel functions. To learn the projections, the method employs a subset of samples belonging to the unchanged areas or to uninteresting radiometric differences. Since the availability of ground truth information to perform model selection is limited, we propose a completely automatic strategy to select the hyperparameters of the system as well as the dimensionality of the transformed (latent) space. The proposed scheme is fully automatic and allows the use of any change detection algorithm in the transformed latent space. A synthetic problem built from real images and a case study involving a real cross-sensor change detection problem illustrate the capabilities of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed system outperforms the linear baseline and provides accuracies close the ones obtained with a fully supervised strategy. We provide a MATLAB implementation of the proposed method as well as the real cross-sensor data we prepared and employed at https://sites.google.com/site/michelevolpiresearch/codes/cross-sensor.

    The main objective of this letter is to improve the accuracy of unsupervised change detection method and minimize registration errors among multi-temporal images in the change detection process. To this end, iteratively regularized multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) is applied to synthetically fused images. First, four synthetically fused hyperspectral images are generated using the block-based fusion method. Then, the IR-MAD is applied to three pairs of the fused images using integrated IR-MAD variates, to decrease the falsely detected changes. To focus on the mis- registration effects, we apply the method to both a correctly registered data-set and a data-set with deliberately misaligned images. In this experiment using multi-temporal Hyperion images, the changed areas are more efficiently detected by our method than by the original IR-MAD algorithm.

    本文的主要目的是提高无监督变化检测方法的准确性，在变化检测过程中尽量减小多时间图像之间的配准误差。为此，将迭代正则化多变量变化检测(IR-MAD)应用于综合融合图像。首先，利用基于块的融合方法生成了四幅综合融合的高光谱图像。然后，利用积分的IR-MAD变量对三对融合后的图像进行IR-MAD变换，以减少误检的变化。为了关注错误配准的影响，我们将该方法应用于正确注册的数据集和故意对齐图像的数据集。在多时间海波图像的实验中，我们的方法比原irmad算法更有效地检测出了变化区域。

    Due to rapid changes on the Earth's surface, it is important to perform land cover change detection (CD) at a fine spatial and fine temporal resolution. However, remote sensing images with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions are commonly not available or, where available, may be expensive to obtain. This paper attempts to achieve fine spatial and temporal resolution land cover CD with a new computer technology based on subpixel mapping (SPM): The fine spatial resolution land cover maps (FRMs) are first predicted through SPM of the coarse spatial but fine temporal resolution images, and then, subpixel resolution CD is performed by comparison of class labels in the SPM results. For the first time, five fast SPM algorithms, including bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation, subpixel/pixel spatial attraction model, Kriging, and radial basis function interpolation methods, are proposed for subpixel resolution CD. The auxiliary information from the known FRM on one date is incorporated in SPM of coarse images on other dates to increase the CD accuracy. Based on the five fast SPM algorithms and the availability of the FRM, subpixels for each class are predicted by comparison of the estimated soft class values at the target fine spatial resolution and borrowing information from the FRM. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the five SPM algorithms using FRM in subpixel resolution CD. They are fast methods to achieve subpixel resolution CD.

    由于地球表面的快速变化，在精细的时空分辨率下进行土地覆被变化检测(CD)显得尤为重要。然而，具有良好的空间和时间分辨率的遥感图像通常是不可得的，或者在可得的情况下，可能是昂贵的。本文试图实现精细的空间和时间分辨率土地覆盖CD新计算机技术基于亚像素映射(SPM):精细的空间分辨率土地覆盖地图(农场)是第一个预测通过SPM粗空间,但好的时间分辨率图像,然后,亚像素分辨率CD相比之下执行的类标签SPM的结果。第一次五快SPM算法,包括双线性插值、双立方插值,亚像素/像素空间引力模型,克里格,和径向基函数插值方法,提出了亚像素分辨率CD。纳在一个已知的辅助信息日期是在SPM粗图像注册在其他日期增加CD的准确性。基于五种快速SPM算法和FRM的可用性，通过比较目标精细空间分辨率下的估计软类值，并借鉴FRM的信息，对每个类的子像素进行预测。实验证明了五种基于FRM的SPM算法在亚像素分辨率CD中的可行性，是实现亚像素分辨率CD的一种快速方法。

    Unsupervised change detection techniques have been widely employed in the remote-sensing area when suitable reference data is not available. Image (or Index) differencing is one of the most commonly used methods due to its simplicity. However, past applications of image differencing were often inefficient in separating real change and noise due to the lack of steps for feature selection and integration of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised procedure which uses two complementary features, namely luminance and saturation, extracted from multispectral images, and combines T-point thresholding, Bayes fusion, and Markov Random Fields. Through a case study, the performance of our proposed procedure was compared with other three unsupervised change-detection methods including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy c-means (FCM), and Expectation Maximum-Markov Random Field (EM-MRF). The change detection results from our proposed method are more compact with less noise than those from other methods over urban areas. The quantitative accuracy assessment indicates that the overall accuracy and Kappa statistic of our proposed procedure are 95.1 percent and 83.3 percent, respectively, which are significantly higher than the other three unsupervised change detection methods.

    当没有合适的参考数据时，无监督变化检测技术在遥感领域得到了广泛的应用。图像(或索引)差分是最常用的方法之一，因为它简单。然而，由于缺乏特征选择和上下文信息集成的步骤，以往的图像差分方法在分离真实变化和噪声方面往往效率不高。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的无监督程序，它利用亮度和饱和度这两个互补的特征，从多光谱图像中提取，并结合了t点阈值、贝叶斯融合和马尔可夫随机场。通过实例分析，将该方法与主成分分析(PCA)、模糊c均值(FCM)和期望最大马尔可夫随机场(EM-MRF)等三种无监督变化检测方法进行了比较。与其它方法相比，本文方法的变化检测结果更紧凑、噪声更小。定量精度评估表明，本方法的总体精度为95.1%，Kappa统计量为83.3%，显著高于其他三种无监督变化检测方法。

    The change of buildings is one of the most valuable information in the monitoring of land use for urban areas. Change detection technique based on multitemporal remote sensing image is an effective approach to obtain information of feature change. However, with the continuous improvement of resolution in remote sensing image, conventional change detection methods have much difficulty in exactly extracting building changes. One difficulty is the displacement for buildings between the Multitemporal remote sensing images due to the different view angles of sensors, another difficulty is the shadows, the above-mentioned difficulties are highlighted in the high-resolution remotely sensed Images. In this paper, a novel method for the detection of building changes from high-resolution images in urban areas is proposed, the candidate changed areas are obtained base on the spectral difference, and then a semantic dependency relation is integrated by a morphological building index technique and a shadow detection method to identify the real changes. The proposed method is evaluated with a pair of QuickBird images of Qingdao City, China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method have a better performance to extract the building changes.

    建筑物的变化是城市土地利用监测中最有价值的信息之一。基于多时相遥感图像的变化检测技术是获取特征变化信息的有效途径。然而，随着遥感图像分辨率的不断提高，传统的变化检测方法难以准确提取建筑物的变化。其中一个难点是由于传感器视角的不同，使得建筑物在多时间遥感图像之间产生位移，另一个难点是阴影，这些难点在高分辨率遥感图像中凸显出来。本文提出了一种从城市高分辨率图像中检测建筑物变化的新方法，基于谱差获取候选的变化区域，然后利用形态建筑指标技术和阴影检测方法结合语义依赖关系来识别真实的变化。通过对青岛市QuickBird图像的分析，对该方法进行了评价。实验结果表明，该方法具有较好的提取建筑物变化的性能。

    In this letter, a change detection algorithm based on pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNN) and the normalized moment of inertia (NMI) feature is proposed for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. To better analyze a large remote sensing image, the whole image is divided into blocks by the use of a deblocking mechanism. The PCNN model is utilized to obtain the initial binary image, and the NMI feature is calculated based on the binary image to detect the hot spot changed areas. Finally, the changed areas are processed by expectation-maximization to obtain the final change map. The experimental results using QuickBird and IKONOS images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the ability to provide better change detection results for HSR images than the traditional PCNN change detection algorithms.
