    In this Letter, an unsupervised algorithm for detecting changes in multi-spectral and multi-temporal remotely-sensed images is presented. Such an algorithm makes it possible to reduce the effects of 'registration noise' on the accuracy of change detection. In addition, it can be used to reduce the typologies of detected changes in order to better locate the changes under investigation.

    A novel unsupervised technique for the detection of changes in multitemporal remote sensing images is presented. It adaptively exploits the spatial-contextual information contained in the neighbourhood of each pixel to reduce the effects of noise and hence to increase change-detection accuracy. In addition, the proposed definition of an adaptive pixel neighbourhood allows a precise location of the borders of changed areas.

    One of the main problems related to unsupervised change detection methods based on the "difference image" lies in the lack of efficient automatic techniques for discriminating between changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image, Such discrimination is usually performed by using empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, which affect both the accuracy and the reliability of the change-detection process. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, we propose two automatic techniques (based on the Bayes theory) for the analysis of the difference image. One allows an automatic selection of the decision threshold that minimizes the overall change detection error probability under the assumption that pixels in the difference image are independent of one another. The other analyzes the difference image by considering the spatial- contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel. In particular, an approach based on Markov Random Fields (MRF's) that exploits interpixel class dependency contexts is presented. Both proposed techniques require the knowledge of the statistical distributions of the changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. To perform an unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms that characterize these distributions, we propose an iterative method based on the Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

    基于“差分图像”的无监督变化检测方法存在的主要问题之一是缺乏有效的自动识别差分图像中变化和不变像素的技术，这种识别通常采用经验策略或手工试错过程进行，影响了变化检测过程的准确性和可靠性。为了克服这些缺点，本文提出了两种基于贝叶斯理论的差分图像自动分析技术。一种方法允许在假设不同图像中的像素彼此独立的情况下，自动选择决策阈值，从而最小化总体变化检测错误概率。另一种是通过考虑每个像素邻域所包含的空间上下文信息来分析图像的差异。提出了一种基于马尔可夫随机域(MRF)的像素间类依赖上下文挖掘方法。这两种方法都需要知道差分图像中变化和不变像素的统计分布。为了对描述这些分布的统计项进行无监督估计，我们提出了一种基于期望最大化(EM)算法的迭代方法。实验结果验证了两种方法的有效性。

    We propose an automatic thresholding technique for difference images in unsupervised change detection. Such a technique takes into account the different costs that may be associated with commission and omission errors in the selection of the decision threshold. This allows the generation of maps in which the overall change-detection cost is minimized, i.e. the more critical kind of error is reduced according to end-user requirements.

    提出了一种用于无监督变化检测的差分图像自动阈值技术。这种技术考虑到在选择决策阈值时可能与委托和遗漏错误相关的不同成本。这使得生成的地图可以将总体变化检测成本降到最低，即根据最终用户的需求减少更关键的错误类型。

    In this paper, a novel automatic approach to the unsupervised identification of changes in multitemporal remote-sensing images is proposed. This approach, unlike classical ones, is based on the formulation of the unsupervised change-detection problem in terms of the Bayesian decision theory. In this context, an adaptive semiparametric technique for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms associated with the gray levels of changed and unchanged pixels in a difference image is presented. Such a technique exploits the effectivenesses of two theoretically well-founded estimation procedures: the reduced Parzen estimate (RPE) procedure and the expectation- maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, thanks to the resulting estimates and to a Markov Random Field (MRF) approach used to model the spatial-contextual information contained in the multitemporal images considered, a change detection map is generated. The adaptive semiparametric nature of the proposed technique allows its application to different kinds of remote- sensing images. Experimental results, obtained on two sets of multitemporal remote-sensing images acquired by two different sensors, confirm the validity of the proposed approach.

    本文提出了一种新的多时间遥感图像变化无监督自动识别方法。与经典方法不同的是，该方法是基于贝叶斯决策理论建立的无监督变化检测问题。在此背景下，提出了一种自适应半参数估计方法，用于非监督估计与差分图像中变化和不变像素灰度相关的统计项。这种技术利用了两个理论上有充分根据的估计过程的有效性:减少Parzen估计(RPE)过程和期望最大化(EM)算法。然后，由于结果估计和马尔可夫随机场(MRF)方法用于建模包含在多时间图像中的空间-上下文信息，生成了一个变化检测地图。该方法具有自适应半参数特性，可应用于不同类型的遥感图像。在两组不同传感器采集的多时间遥感图像上进行了实验，验证了该方法的有效性。

    In this paper, an approach to reducing the effects of registration noise in unsupervised change detection is proposed. The approach is formulated in the framework of the change vector analysis (CVA) technique. It is composed of two main phases. The first phase aims at estimating in an adaptive way (given the specific pair of images considered) the registration-noise distribution in the magnitude-direction domain of the difference vectors. The second phase exploits the estimated distribution to define an effective decision strategy to be applied to the difference image. Such a strategy allows one to perform change detection by significantly reducing the effects of registration noise. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real multitemporal datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    This paper addresses the problem of detecting land-cover transitions by analysing multitemporal remote-sensing images. In order to develop an effective system for the detection of land-cover transitions, an ensemble of non-parametric multitemporal classifiers is defined and integrated in the context of a multiple classifier system (MCS). Each multitemporal classifier is developed in the framework of the compound classification (CC) decision rule. To develop as uncorrelated as possible classification procedures, the estimates of statistical parameters of classifiers are carried out according to different approaches (i.e., multilayer perceptron neural networks, radial basis functions neural networks, and k-nearest neighbour technique). The outputs provided by different classifiers are combined according to three standard stratcaies extended to the compound classification case (i.e., Majority voting, Bayesian average, and Bayesian,weighted average). Experiments, carried out on a multitemporal. remote-sensing data set, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system.

    This paper presents a novel approach to change detection in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed approach exploits a wavelet-based multiscale decomposition of the log-ratio image (obtained by a comparison of the original multitemporal data) aimed at achieving different scales (levels) of representation of the change signal. Each scale is characterized by a different tradeoff between speckle reduction and preservation of geometrical details. For each pixel, a subset of reliable scales is identified on the basis of a local statistic measure applied to scale- dependent log-ratio images. The final changedetection result is obtained according to an adaptive scale-driven fusion algorithm. Experimental results obtained on multitemporal SAR images acquired by the ERS-1 satellite confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

9.	Bazi, Y., et al. (2005). "**An unsupervised approach based on the generalized Gaussian model to automatic change detection in multitemporal SAR images**." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 43(4): 874-887.

    In this paper, we present a novel automatic and unsupervised change-detection approach specifically oriented to the analysis of multitemporal single-channel single-polarization synthetic aperture radar(SAR) images. This approach is based on a closed-loop process made up of three main steps: 1) a novel preprocessing based on a controlled adaptive iterative filtering; 2) a comparison between multitemporal images carried out according to a standard log-ratio operator; and 3) a novel approach to the automatic analysis of the log-ratio image for generating the change-detection map. The first step aims at reducing the speckle noise in a controlled way in order to maximize the discrimination capability between changed and unchanged classes. In the second step, the two filtered multitemporal images are compared to generate a log-ratio image that contains explicit information on changed areas. The third step produces the change-detection map according to a thresholding procedure based on a reformulation of the Kittler-Illingworth (KI) threshold selection criterion. In particular, the modified KI criterion is derived under the generalized Gaussian assumption for modeling the distributions of changed and unchanged classes. This parametric model was chosen because it is capable of better fitting the conditional densities of classes in the log-ratio image. In order to control the filtering step and, accordingly, the effects of the filtering process on change- detection accuracy, we propose to identify automatically the optimal number of despeckling filter iterations [Step 1)] by analyzing the behavior of the modified KI criterion. This results in a completely automatic and self-consistent change-detection approach that avoids the use of empirical methods for the selection of the best number of filtering iterations. Experiments carried out on two sets of multitemporal images (characterized by different levels of speckle noise) acquired by the European Remote Sensing 2 satellite SAR sensor confirm the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised approach, which results in change-detection accuracies very similar to those that can be achieved by a manual supervised thresholding.

    针对多时间单通道单偏振合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像分析，提出了一种新的自动无监督变化检测方法。该方法基于一个由三个主要步骤组成的闭环过程:1)基于受控自适应迭代滤波的预处理;2)根据标准对数比算子对多时间图像进行比较;3)提出了一种对数比图像自动分析生成变化检测图的新方法。第一步是控制散斑噪声，最大限度地提高变类和未变类之间的分辨能力。在第二步中，将两个经过过滤的多时间图像进行比较，以生成包含关于更改区域的显式信息的对数比图像。第三步是基于kitler - illingworth (KI)阈值选择准则的重新制定，根据阈值化过程生成变化检测图。特别地，在广义高斯假设下推导了修正的KI准则，用于对变化类和未变化类的分布进行建模。之所以选择这个参数模型，是因为它能够更好地拟合对数比图像中类的条件密度。为了控制滤波步骤，进而控制滤波过程对变化检测精度的影响，我们提出通过分析修正后的KI准则的行为，自动识别去屑滤波迭代的最优次数[step1]。这导致了一种完全自动和自洽的变化检测方法，避免使用经验方法来选择最佳的滤波迭代次数。实验进行了两组多瞬时图像(表现为不同程度的散斑噪声)收购欧洲遥感卫星SAR传感器2确认提出的无监督方法的有效性,在变化检测结果精度非常类似,可以通过手动监督阈值。

    In this letter, we propose an extension of an automatic and unsupervised change-detection method for synthetic aperture radar images we presented earlier. By analyzing a properly defined cost function, the proposed method allows the automatic detection of the number (zero, one, or two) and the values of the decision thresholds associated with changes (if any) in the log-ratio image. This cost function is the minimum value of the criterion function adopted to select the decision threshold in the log-ratio image according to a modified double-thresholding Kittler-Illingworth algorithm (implemented under the generalized Gaussian assumption for changed and unchanged classes). Experimental results carried out both on real and simulated multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images proved the effectiveness of the proposed automatic method in detecting both the number of changes to be identified (the situation of no changes is also explicitly identified) and the related threshold values.

    在这封信中，我们提出了一个扩展的自动和无监督的变化检测方法的合成孔径雷达图像我们之前提出。通过分析一个正确定义的成本函数，该方法允许自动检测数字(0、1或2)和与log-ratio图像中变化相关的决策阈值(如果有的话)。该代价函数是根据改进的双阈值基特勒-伊林格沃斯算法(在广义高斯假设下实现，适用于变化类和未变化类)在对数比图像中选择决策阈值所采用的准则函数的最小值。对实际和仿真的多时间合成孔径雷达图像进行的实验结果证明了该方法在检测待识别的变化数(同时明确识别无变化的情况)和相关阈值方面的有效性。

11.	Joshi, M. V., et al. (2006). "**A model-based approach to multiresolution fusion in remotely sensed images**." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 44(9): 2549-2562.

    In this paper, a model-based approach to multiresolution fusion of remotely sensed images is presented. Given a high spatial resolution panchromatic (Pan) image and a low spatial resolution multispectral (MS) image acquired on the same geographical area, the presented method aims to enhance the spatial resolution of the MS image to the resolution of the Pan observation. The proposed fusion technique utilizes the spatial correlation of each of the high-resolution MS channels by using an autoregressive (AR) model, whose parameters are learnt from the analysis of the Pan data. Under the assumption that the parameters of the AR model for the Pan image are the same as those that represent the MS images due to spectral correlation, the proposed technique exploits the learnt parameter values in the context of a proper regularization technique to estimate the high spatial resolution fields for the MS bands. This results in a combination of the spectral characteristics of the low-resolution MS data with the high spatial resolution of the Pan image. The main advantages of the proposed technique are: 1) unlike standard methods proposed in the literature, it requires no registration between the Pan and the MS images; 2) it models effectively the texture of the scene during the fusion process; 3) it shows very small spectral distortion (as it is less affected, compared to standard methods, by the specific digital numbers of pixels in the Pan image, since it exploits the learnt parameters from the Pan image rather than the actual Pan digital numbers for fusion); and 4) it can be used in critical situations in which the Pan and the MS images are acquired (also by different sensors) in slightly different areas. Quantitative experimental results obtained using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Quickbird images point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    提出了一种基于模型的遥感图像多分辨率融合方法。针对同一地理区域获得的高空间分辨率全色(Pan)图像和低空间分辨率多光谱(MS)图像，提出了一种提高MS图像空间分辨率对Pan观测分辨率的方法。该融合技术利用了高分辨率MS通道的空间相关性，采用自回归(AR)模型，其参数从Pan数据分析中获取。假设下的参数AR模型平移图像是一样的那些女士代表图像由于光谱相关性,提出这项技术利用学参数值在一个合适的正则化技术来估计的高空间分辨率字段女士。这使得低分辨率MS数据的光谱特征与高空间分辨率的Pan图像相结合。该方法的主要优点是:1)与文献中提出的标准方法不同，它不需要Pan与MS图像之间的配准;2)有效地对融合过程中的场景纹理进行建模;3)光谱失真非常小(与标准方法相比，它受Pan图像中特定像素数字的影响较小，因为它利用从Pan图像中学习到的参数，而不是实际的Pan数字数字进行融合);4)可用于Pan和MS图像采集的关键场合(也可由不同的传感器)，采集区域略有不同。利用Landsat增强专题地图+ (ETM+)和Quickbird图像定量实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。

    This paper presents a split-based approach (SBA) to automatic and unsupervised change detection in large-size multitemporal remote-sensing images. Unlike standard methods that are presented in the literature, the proposed approach can detect in a consistent And reliable way changes in images of large size also when the extension of the changed area is small (and, therefore, the prior probability of the class of changed pixels is very small). The method is based on the following: 1) a split of the large-size image into subimages; 2) an adaptive analysis of-each subimage; and 3) an automatic split-based threshold-selection procedure. This general approach is used for defining a system for damage assessment in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed system has been developed to properly identify different levels of damages that are induced by tsunamis along coastal areas. Experimental results that are obtained on multitemporal RADARSAT-1 SAR images of the Sumatra Island, Indonesia, confirm the effectiveness of both the proposed SBA and the presented system for tsunami-damage assessment.

    提出了一种基于分裂的大尺度多时间遥感图像自动无监督变化检测方法。与文献中给出的标准方法不同，本文提出的方法可以在变化区域的扩展范围很小(因此，变化像素类的先验概率非常小)的情况下，以一致可靠的方式检测大尺寸图像的变化。该方法基于以下几个方面:1)将大尺寸图像分割为子图像;2)每个子图像的自适应分析;3)基于分裂的阈值自动选择过程。该方法用于定义多时间合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像损伤评估系统。这个拟议的系统是为了正确识别沿海地区海啸所造成的不同程度的损害。在印度尼西亚苏门答腊岛的多时间雷达SAR图像上获得的实验结果证实了所提出的SBA和所提出的海啸损害评估系统的有效性。

13.	Ghosh, S., et al. (2007). "**A context-sensitive technique for unsupervised change detection based on Hopfield-type neural networks**." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 45(3): 778-789.

    In this paper, we propose a context-sensitive technique for unsupervised change detection in multitemporal remote sensing images. This technique is based on a modified Hopfield neural network architecture designed to model spatial correlation between neighboring pixels of the difference image produced by comparing images acquired on the same area at different times. Each spatial position in the considered scene is represented by a neuron in the Hopfield network that is connected only to its neighboring units. These connections model the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels and are associated with a context-sensitive energy function that represents the overall, status of the network. Change detection maps are obtained by iteratively updating the output status of the neurons until a minimum of the energy function is reached and the network assumes a stable state. A simple heuristic thresholding procedure is presented and adopted for initializing the network. The proposed change detection technique is unsupervised and distribution free. Experimental results carried out on two multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

    提出了一种基于上下文敏感的多时间遥感图像无监督变化检测技术。该方法基于改进的Hopfield神经网络结构，通过对同一区域不同时间采集的图像进行比较，得到不同图像的相邻像素之间的空间相关性模型。在所考虑的场景中，每个空间位置都由Hopfield网络中的一个神经元表示，该神经元只与相邻的单元相连。这些连接模拟相邻像素之间的空间相关性，并与表示网络总体状态的上下文敏感的能量函数相关联。通过迭代更新神经元的输出状态，直到能量函数达到最小值，网络处于稳定状态，得到变化检测图。提出了一种简单的启发式阈值化方法，并采用该方法对网络进行初始化。所提出的变化检测技术是无监督、无分布的。在两幅多光谱和多时间遥感图像上的实验结果验证了该方法的有效性。

    This paper addresses unsupervised change detection by proposing a proper framework for a formal definition and a theoretical study of the change vector analysis (CVA) technique. This framework, which is based on the representation of the CVA in polar coordinates, aims at: 1) introducing a set of formal definitions in the polar domain (which are linked to the properties of the data) for a better general description (and thus understanding) of the information present in spectral change vectors;2) analyzing from a theoretical point of view the distributions of changed and unchanged pixels in the polar domain (also according to possible simplifying assumptions); 3) driving the implementation of proper preprocessing procedures to be applied to multitemporal images on the basis of the results of the theoretical study on the distributions; and 4) defining a solid background for the development of advanced and accurate automatic change-detection algorithms in the polar domain. The findings derived from the theoretical analysis on the statistical models of classes have been validated on real multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images according to both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results obtained confirm the interest of the proposed framework and the validity of the related theoretical analysis.

15.	Bazi, Y., et al. (2007). "**Image thresholding based on the EM algorithm and the generalized Gaussian distribution**." Pattern Recognition 40(2): 619-634.

    In this paper. a novel parametric and global image histogram thresholding method is presented. It is based on the estimation of the statistical parameters of "object" and "background" classes by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, under the assumption that these two classes follow a generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution. The adoption of such a statistical model as an alternative to the more common Gaussian model is motivated by its attractive capability to approximate a broad variety of statistical behaviors with a small number of parameters. Since the quality of the solution provided by the iterative EM algorithm is strongly affected by initial conditions (which. if inappropriately set, may lead to unreliable estimation), a robust initialization strategy based on genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    An unsupervised technique for change detection (CD) in very high geometrical resolution images is proposed, which is based on the use of morphological filters. This technique integrates the nonlinear and adaptive properties of the morphological filters with a change vector analysis (CVA) procedure. Different morphological operators are analyzed and compared with respect to the CD problem. Alternating sequential filters by reconstruction proved to be the most effective, permitting the preservation of the geometrical information of the structures in the scene while filtering the homogeneous areas. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. It increases the accuracy of the CD process as compared with the standard CVA approach.

    This paper addresses the problem of matching the statistical properties of the distributions of two (or more) multispectral remote sensing images acquired on the same geographical area at different times. An N-D probability density function (pdf) matching technique for the preprocessing of multitemporal images is introduced in the remote sensing domain by defining and analyzing three important application scenarios: 1) supervised classification; 2) partially supervised classification; and 3) change detection. Unlike other methods adopted in remote sensing applications, the procedure considered performs the matching process by properly taking into account the correlation among spectral channels, thus retaining the data correlation structure after the pdf matching. Experimental results obtained on real multitemporal remote sensing data sets confirm the validity of the presented technique in all the considered scenarios.

    This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised change detection in multispectral remote- sensing images. The proposed approach aims at extracting the change information by jointly analyzing the spectral channels of multitemporal images in the original feature space without any training data. This is accomplished by using a selective Bayesian thresholding for deriving a pseudotraining set that is necessary for initializing an adequately defined binary semisupervised support vector machine (S(3)VM) classifier. Starting from these initial seeds,the S(3)VM performs change detection in the original multitemporal feature space by gradually considering unlabeled patterns in the definition of the decision boundary between changed and unchanged pixels according to a semisupervised learning algorithm. This algorithm models the full complexity of the change- detection problem, which is only partially represented from the seed pixels included in the pseudotraining set. The values of the classifier parameters are then defined according to a novel unsupervised model-selection technique based on a similarity measure between change-detection maps obtained with different settings. Experimental results obtained on different multispectral remote-sensing images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

19.	Brunner, D., et al. (2009). "**Distributed Geospatial Data Processing Functionality to Support Collaborative and Rapid Emergency Response**." IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing 2(1): 33-46.

    This paper presents a novel approach to integrate the latest generation very high-resolution earth observation imagery into the operational workflow of geospatial information support for emergency response actions. The core concept behind this approach is the implementation of an image pyramid structure that allows each image tile to be addressed separately. We propose a novel way to collate geospatial feature data from distributed sources and integrate them in visualization and image processing. The system components enable rapid collaborative mapping, support for in situ data collection, customized on-demand image processing, and geospatial data queries and near instantaneous map visualization.

    This paper analyzes the problem of change detection in very high resolution (VHR) multitemporal images by studying the effects of residual misregistration [registration noise (RN)] between images acquired on the same geographical area at different times. In particular, according to an experimental analysis driven from a theoretical study, the main effects of RN on VHR images are identified and some important properties are derived and described in a polar framework for change vector analysis. In addition, a technique for an adaptive and unsupervised explicit estimation of the RN distribution in the polar domain is proposed. This technique derives the RN distribution according to both a multiscale analysis of the distribution of spectral change vectors and the Parzen windows method. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real multitemporal data sets confirm the validity of the proposed analysis, the reliability of the derived properties on RN, and the effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique. This technique represents a very promising tool for the definition of change-detection methods for VHR multitemporal images robust to RN.

    In this paper, we present a novel, automatic and unsupervised change-detection approach to the analysis of single-channel single-polarization multitemporal SAR images. The statistical parameters of the changed and unchanged classes, which are assumed to follow a generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution in the analysed log-ratio image, are explicitly estimated by the expectation- maximization (EM) algorithm initialized with a robust strategy based on genetic algorithms (GAs). In addition, the proposed approach integrates two further processing capabilities. The first one intends to cope with the problem of the automatic detection of multiple changes in the scene. This is carried out by modelling the log-ratio image histogram with a multimodal GG mixture whose number of components is estimated basing on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The second processing capability allows exploitation of spatial contextual information in the change detection process through a Markovian formulation. Results obtained on both simulated and real data are reported and discussed.

    This letter presents a novel parcel-based context-sensitive technique for unsupervised change detection in very high geometrical resolution images. In order to improve pixel-based change- detection performance, we propose to exploit the spatial-context information in the framework of a multilevel approach. The proposed technique models the scene (and hence changes) at different resolution levels defining multitemporal and multilevel "parcels" (i.e., small homogeneous regions shared by both original images). Change detection is achieved by applying a multilevel change vector analysis to each pixel of the considered images. This technique properly analyzes the multilevel and multitemporal parcel-based context information of the considered spatial position. The adaptive nature of multitemporal parcels and their multilevel representation allow one a proper modeling of complex objects in the investigated scene as well as borders and details of the changed areas. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    This paper presents two semisupervised one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) classifiers for remote sensing applications. In one-class image classification, one tries to detect pixels belonging to one of the classes in the image and reject the others. When few labeled pixels of only one class are available, obtaining a reliable classifier is a difficult task. In the particular case of SVM-based classifiers, this task is even harder because the free parameters of the model need to be finely adjusted, but no clear criterion can be adopted. In order to improve the OC-SVM classifier accuracy and alleviate the problem of free-parameter selection, the information provided by unlabeled samples present in the scene can be used. In this paper, we present two state-of-the-art algorithms for semisupervised one-class classification for remote sensing classification problems. The first proposed algorithm is based on modifying the OC-SVM kernel by modeling the data marginal distribution with the graph Laplacian built with both labeled and unlabeled samples. The second one is based on a simple modification of the standard SVM cost function which penalizes more the errors made when classifying samples of the target class. The good performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in four challenging remote sensing image classification scenarios where the goal is to detect one of the classes present on the scene. In particular, we present results for multisource urban monitoring, hyperspectral crop detection, multispectral cloud screening, and change-detection problems. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed techniques, particularly in cases with few or poorly representative labeled samples.

    提出了两种用于遥感应用的半冗余单类支持向量机分类器。在单类图像分类中，试图检测属于图像中的一个类的像素，并拒绝其他类。当只有一个类的标记像素很少时，获得一个可靠的分类器是一项困难的任务。在基于svm的分类器的特殊情况下，由于模型的自由参数需要进行精细调整，而不能采用明确的判据，使得该任务更加困难。为了提高OC-SVM分类器的分类精度，缓解自由参数选择问题，可以利用场景中未标记样本提供的信息。针对遥感分类问题，提出了两种最先进的半冗余单类分类算法。第一个算法是在修改OC-SVM核函数的基础上，利用标记样本和未标记样本构建的Laplacian图对数据边缘分布进行建模。第二种方法是对标准SVM代价函数进行简单的修正，对目标类样本进行分类时产生的误差进行了补偿。提出的方法在四个具有挑战性的遥感图像分类场景中表现出了良好的性能，目标是检测场景中出现的类之一。特别地，我们提出了多源城市监测、高光谱作物检测、多光谱云筛选和变化检测问题的结果。实验结果表明，该技术的适用性，特别是在极少数或代表性较差的标记样品。

    This paper presents an automatic context-sensitive technique robust to registration noise (RN) for change detection (CD) in multitemporal very high geometrical resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. Exploiting the properties of RN in VHR images, the proposed technique analyzes the distribution of the spectral change vectors (SCVs) computed according to the change vector analysis (CVA) in a quantized polar domain. The method studies the SCVs falling into each quantization cell at different resolution levels (scales) to automatically identify the effects of RN in the polar domain. This information is jointly exploited with the spatial context information contained in the neighborhood of each pixel for generating the final CD map. The spatial context information is modeled through the definition of adaptive regions homogeneous both in spatial and temporal domain (parcels). Experimental results obtained on real VHR remote sensing multitemporal images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

    In this letter, we investigate the effects of pansharpening (PS) applied to multispectral (MS) multitemporal images in change-detection (CD) applications. Although CD maps computed from pansharpened data show an enhanced spatial resolution, they can suffer from errors due to artifacts induced by the fusion process. The rationale of our analysis consists in understanding to which extent such artifacts can affect spatially enhanced CD maps. To this end, a quantitative analysis is performed which is based on a novel strategy that exploits similarity measures to rank PS methods according to their impact on CD performance. Many multiresolution fusion algorithms are considered, and CD results obtained from original MS and from spatially enhanced data are compared.

    Rapid damage assessment after natural disasters (e. g., earthquakes) and violent conflicts (e. g., war- related destruction) is crucial for initiating effective emergency response actions. Remote-sensing satellites equipped with very high spatial resolution (VHR) multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensors can provide vital information due to their ability to map the affected areas with high geometric precision and in an uncensored manner. In this paper, we present a novel method that detects buildings destroyed in an earthquake using pre-event VHR optical and post- event detected VHR SAR imagery. The method operates at the level of individual buildings and assumes that they have a rectangular footprint and are isolated. First, the 3-D parameters of a building are estimated from the pre-event optical imagery. Second, the building information and the acquisition parameters of the VHR SAR scene are used to predict the expected signature of the building in the post-event SAR scene assuming that it is not affected by the event. Third, the similarity between the predicted image and the actual SAR image is analyzed. If the similarity is high, the building is likely to be still intact, whereas a low similarity indicates that the building is destroyed. A similarity threshold is used to classify the buildings. We demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the method for a subset of the town of Yingxiu, China, which was heavily damaged in the Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008. For the experiment, we use QuickBird and WorldView-1 optical imagery, and TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed SAR data.

    This paper formulates the problem of distinguishing changed from unchanged pixels in multitemporal remote sensing images as a minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem with changed pixels as target class. The definition of the sphere-shaped decision boundary with minimal volume that embraces changed pixels is approached in the context of the support vector formalism adopting a support vector domain description (SVDD) one-class classifier. SVDD maps the data into a high dimensional feature space where the spherical support of the high dimensional distribution of changed pixels is computed. Unlike the standard SVDD, the proposed formulation of the SVDD uses both target and outlier samples for defining the MEB, and is included here in an unsupervised scheme for change detection. To this purpose, nearly certain training examples for the classes of both targets (i.e., changed pixels) and outliers (i.e., unchanged pixels) are identified by thresholding the magnitude of the spectral change vectors. Experimental results obtained on two different multitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    This paper presents a novel iterative active learning (AL) technique aimed at defining effective multitemporal training sets to be used for the supervised detection of land-cover transitions in a pair of remote sensing images acquired on the same area at different times. The proposed AL technique is developed in the framework of the Bayes' rule for compound classification. At each iteration, it selects the pair of spatially aligned unlabeled pixels in the two images that are classified with the maximum uncertainty. These pixels are then labeled by an external supervisor and included in the training set. The uncertainty of a pair of pixels is assessed by the joint entropy defined by considering two possible different simplifying assumptions: 1) class-conditional independence and
    1) temporal independence between multitemporal images. Accordingly, different algorithms are introduced. The proposed joint-entropy-based AL algorithms for compound classification are compared with each other and with a marginal-entropy-based AL technique (in which the entropy is computed separately on single-date images) applied to the postclassification comparison method. The experimental results obtained on two multispectral and multitemporal data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

    This paper addresses the problem of land-cover map updating by classification of multitemporal remote-sensing images in the context of domain adaptation (DA). The basic assumptions behind the proposed approach are twofold. The first one is that training data (ground reference information) are available for one of the considered multitemporal acquisitions (source domain) whereas they are not for the other (target domain). The second one is that multitemporal acquisitions (i.e., target and source domains) may be characterized by different sets of classes. Unlike other approaches available in the literature, the proposed DA Bayesian classifier based on maximum a posteriori decision rule (DA-MAP) automatically identifies whether there exist differences between the set of classes in the target and source domains and properly handles these differences in the updating process. The proposed method was tested in different scenarios of increasing complexity related to multitemporal image classification. Experimental results on medium-resolution and very high resolution multitemporal remote-sensing data sets confirm the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed DA-MAP classifier.

    The detection of multiple changes (i.e., different kinds of change) in multitemporal remote sensing images is a complex problem. When multispectral images having B spectral bands are considered, an effective solution to this problem is to exploit all available spectral channels in the framework of supervised or partially supervised approaches. However, in many real applications, it is difficult/impossible to collect ground truth information for either multitemporal or single-date images. On the opposite, unsupervised methods available in the literature are not effective in handling the full information present in multispectral and multitemporal images. They usually consider a simplified subspace of the original feature space having small dimensionality and, thus, characterized by a possible loss of change information. In this paper, we present a framework for the detection of multiple changes in bitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images that allows one to overcome the limits of standard unsupervised methods. The framework is based on the following: 1) a compressed yet efficient 2-D representation of the change information and 2) a two-step automatic decision strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been tested on two bitemporal and multispectral data sets having different properties. Results obtained on both data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    多个变化的检测(即在多时相遥感图像中，不同类型的变化)是一个复杂的问题。当考虑具有B波段的多光谱图像时，有效的解决方法是在监督或部分监督方法的框架下利用所有可用的光谱通道。然而，在许多实际应用中，很难/不可能收集多时间或单日期图像的地面真实信息。与此相反，文献中的无监督方法在处理多光谱和多时间图像中的全部信息时并不有效。它们通常考虑原始特征空间的一个子空间的简化，具有较小的维数，因此，其特征是可能丢失更改信息。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架，用于检测双波段和多光谱遥感图像的多种变化，使人们能够克服标准的无监督方法的限制。该框架基于以下内容:1)对变化信息进行压缩而高效的二维表示;2)两步自动决策策略。在两组具有不同性质的双谱和多谱数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。两个数据集的结果验证了该方法的有效性。

    The availability of very high resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which can be acquired by satellites over the same geographical area with short repetition interval, makes the development of effective unsupervised change detection (CD) techniques very important. This paper proposes a hierarchical approach to CD in VHR SAR images for addressing surveillance applications, where VHR data are acquired with high temporal resolution (e. g., one image every few days). The proposed approach is based on two concepts: 1) exploitation of a multiscale technique for a preliminary detection of areas containing changes in backscattering at different scales (hot spots) and 2) explicit modeling of the semantic meaning of changes by using both the intrinsic SAR image properties (e. g., acquisition geometry and scattering mechanisms) and the available prior information. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a problem of freight traffic surveillance is addressed considering two data sets. Each of them is made up of a pair of multitemporal VHR SAR images acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed (COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation) constellation in spotlight mode. Each data set defines a complex CD problem due to both the presence of a variety of changes on the ground and the complexity of object backscattering. Experimental results point out the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    This paper addresses change detection in multitemporal remote sensing images. After a review of the main techniques developed in remote sensing for the analysis of multitemporal data, the attention is focused on the challenging problem of change detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) multispectral images. In this context, we propose a framework that aims at defining a top-down approach to the design of the architecture of novel change-detection systems for multitemporal VHR images. The proposed framework explicitly models the presence of different radiometric changes on the basis of the properties of multitemporal images, extracts the semantic meaning of radiometric changes, identifies changes of interest with strategies designed on the basis of the specific application, and takes advantage of the intrinsic multiscale/multilevel properties of the objects and the high spatial correlation between pixels in a neighborhood. This framework defines guidelines for the development of a new generation of change-detection methods that can properly analyze multitemporal VHR images taking into account the intrinsic complexity associated with these data. In order to illustrate the use of the proposed framework, a real change-detection problem has been considered, which is described by a pair of VHR multispectral images acquired by the QuickBird satellite on the city of Trento, Italy. The proposed framework has been used for defining a system for change detection in the two images. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the developed system and the usefulness of the proposed framework.

    Image classification usually requires the availability of reliable reference data collected for the considered image to train supervised classifiers. Unfortunately when time series of images are considered, this is seldom possible because of the costs associated with reference data collection. In most of the applications it is realistic to have reference data available for one or few images of a time series acquired on the area of interest. In this paper, we present a novel system for automatically classifying image time series that takes advantage of image(s) with an associated reference information (i.e., the source domain) to classify image(s) for which reference information is not available (i.e., the target domain). The proposed system exploits the already available knowledge on the source domain and, when possible, integrates it with a minimum amount of new labeled data for the target domain. In addition, it is able to handle possible significant differences between statistical distributions of the source and target domains. Here, the method is presented in the context of classification of remote sensing image time series, where ground reference data collection is a highly critical and demanding task. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The method can work on multimodal (e.g., multispectral) images.

    This paper proposes a novel change-detection-driven transfer learning (TL) approach to update land-cover maps by classifying remote-sensing images acquired on the same area at different times (i.e., image time series). The proposed approach requires that a reliable training set is available only for one of the images (i.e., the source domain) in the time series whereas it is not for another image to be classified (i.e., the target domain). Unlike other literature TL methods, no additional assumptions on either the similarity between class distributions or the presence of the same set of land-cover classes in the two domains are required. The proposed method aims at defining a reliable training set for the target domain, taking advantage of the already available knowledge on the source domain. This is done by applying an unsupervised-change-detection method to target and source domains and transferring class labels of detected unchanged training samples from the source to the target domain to initialize the target-domain training set. The training set is then optimized by a properly defined novel active learning (AL) procedure. At the early iterations of AL, priority in labeling is given to samples detected as being changed, whereas in the remaining ones, the most informative samples are selected from changed and unchanged unlabeled samples. Finally, the target image is classified. Experimental results show that transferring the class labels from the source domain to the target domain provides a reliable initial training set and that the priority rule for AL results in a fast convergence to the desired accuracy with respect to Standard AL.

    A new approach to change detection in very high resolution remote sensing images based on morphological attribute profiles (APs) is presented. A multiresolution contextual transformation performed by APs allows the extraction of geometrical features related to the structures within the scene at different scales. The temporal changes are detected by comparing the geometrical features extracted from the image of each date. The experiments performed on panchromatic QuickBird images related to an urban area show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting changes on the basis of the spatial morphology by preserving geometrical detail.

    In this paper, a spatiocontextual unsupervised change detection technique for multitemporal, multispectral remote sensing images is proposed. The technique uses a Gibbs Markov random field (GMRF) to model the spatial regularity between the neighboring pixels of the multitemporal difference image. The difference image is generated by change vector analysis applied to images acquired on the same geographical area at different times. The change detection problem is solved using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation principle. The MAP estimator of the GMRF used to model the difference image is exponential in nature, thus a modified Hopfield type neural network (HTNN) is exploited for estimating the MAP. In the considered Hopfield type network, a single neuron is assigned to each pixel of the difference image and is assumed to be connected only to its neighbors. Initial values of the neurons are set by histogram thresholding. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used to estimate the GMRF model parameters. Experiments are carried out on three-multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images. Results of the proposed change detection scheme are compared with those of the manual-trial-and-error technique, automatic change detection scheme based on GMRF model and iterated conditional mode algorithm, a context sensitive change detection scheme based on HTNN, the GMRF model, and a graph-cut algorithm. A comparison points out that the proposed method provides more accurate change detection maps than other methods.

    In this paper we study an effective solution to deal with supervised change detection in very high geometrical resolution (VHR) images. High within-class variance as well as low between-class variance that characterize this kind of imagery make the detection and classification of ground cover transitions a difficult task. In order to achieve high detection accuracy, we propose the inclusion of spatial and contextual information issued from local textural statistics and mathematical morphology. To perform change detection, two architectures, initially developed for medium resolution images, are adapted for VHR: Direct Multi-date Classification and Difference Image Analysis. To cope with the high intra-class variability, we adopted a nonlinear classifier: the Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed approaches are successfully evaluated on two series of pansharpened QuickBird images.

    This paper proposes two approaches to change detection in bitemporal remote sensing images based on concurrent self-organizing maps (CSOM) neural classifier. The first one performs change detection in a supervised way, whereas the second performs change detection in an unsupervised way. The supervised approach is based on two steps: 1) concatenation (CON); and 2) CSOM classification. CSOM classifier uses two SOM modules: 1) one associated to the class of change; and 2) the other to the class of no-change for the generation of the training set. The unsupervised change detection approach is based on four steps: 1) image comparison (IC), consisting of either computation of difference image (DI) for passive sensors or computation of log-ratio image (LRI) for active sensors; 2) unsupervised selection of the pseudotraining sample set (USPS); 3) concatenation (CON); and 4) CSOM classification. The proposed approaches are evaluated using two datasets. First dataset is a LANDSAT-5 TM bitemporal image over Mexico area taken before and after two wildfires, and the second one is a TerraSAR-X image acquired in the Fukushima region, Japan, before and after tsunami. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

    This paper presents a novel spatio-contextual fuzzy clustering algorithm for unsupervised change detection from multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images. The proposed technique uses fuzzy Gibbs Markov, Random Field (GMRF) to model the spatial gray level attributes of the multispectral difference image. The change detection problem is solved using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation principle. The MAP estimator of the fuzzy GMRF modeled difference image is found to be exponential in nature. Convergence of conventional fuzzy clustering based search criterion is more likely to lead the clustering solutions to be getting trapped in a local minimum. Hence we adhered to the variable neighborhood searching (VNS) based global convergence criterion for iterative estimation of the fuzzy GMRF parameters. Experiments are carried out on different multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. It is also noticed that the proposed scheme provides better results with less misclassification error as compared to the existing techniques. The computational time taken by the proposed technique is comparable with that of the HTNN scheme.

    This paper presents an overview on the image fusion concept in the context of multitemporal remote sensing image processing. In the remote sensing literature, multitemporal image analysis mainly deals with the detection of changes and land-cover transitions. Thus the paper presents and analyses the most relevant literature contributions on these topics. From the perspective of change detection and detection of land-cover transitions, multitemporal image analysis techniques can be divided into two main groups: i) those based on the fusion of the multitemporal information at feature level, and
    ii) those based on the fusion of the multitemporal information at decision level. The former mainly exploit multitemporal image comparison techniques, which aim at highlighting the presence/absence of changes by generating change indices. These indices are then analyzed by unsupervised algorithms for extracting the change information. The latter rely mainly on classification and include both supervised and semi/partially-supervised/unsupervised methods. The paper focuses the attention on both standard (and largely used) methods and techniques proposed in the recent literature. The analysis is conducted by considering images acquired by optical and SAR systems at medium, high and very high spatial resolution.

    本文综述了多时间遥感图像处理背景下的图像融合概念。在遥感文献中，多时间图像分析主要处理变化和土地覆盖变化的检测。因此，本文提出并分析了这些主题的相关文献贡献。从变化检测和土地覆被变迁检测的角度来看，多时间图像分析技术主要分为两大类:一是基于特征层次的多时间信息融合技术，二是基于决策层次的多时间信息融合技术。前者主要利用多时间图像比较技术，通过生成变化指数来突出变化的存在/不存在。然后用无监督算法分析这些指标，提取变化信息。后者主要依靠分类，包括监督和半/部分监督/非监督方法。本文主要关注最近文献中提出的标准方法和技术。该分析是考虑光学和SAR系统在中、高、甚高空间分辨率下获取的图像。

    Even after applying effective coregistration methods, multitemporal images are likely to show a residual misalignment, which is referred to as registration noise (RN). This is because coregistration methods from the literature cannot fully handle the local dissimilarities induced by differences in the acquisition conditions (e.g., the stability of the acquisition platform, the off-nadir angle of the sensor, the structure of the considered scene, etc.). This paper addresses the problem of reducing such a residual misalignment by proposing a fine automatic coregistration approach for very high resolution (VHR) multispectral images. The proposed method takes advantage of the properties of
    the residual misalignment itself. To this end, RN is first extracted in the change vector analysis (CVA) polar domain according to the behaviors of the specific multitemporal images considered. Then, a local analysis of RN pixels (i.e., those showing residual misalignment) is conducted for automatically extracting control points (CPs) and matching them according to their estimated displacement. Matched CPs are used for generating a deformation map by interpolation. Finally, one VHR image is warped to the coordinates of the other through a deformation map. Experiments carried out on simulated and real multitemporal VHR images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    即使应用了有效的共配准方法，多时间图像仍有可能出现残留的配准误差，即配准噪声(RN)。这是因为文献中的共配准方法不能完全处理由于采集条件的不同而引起的局部差异(如采集平台的稳定性、传感器的离底角、被考虑场景的结构等)。本文提出了一种高分辨率(VHR)多光谱图像的精细自动配准方法，解决了如何减少这种残留配准误差的问题。该方法利用了残差失调本身的特点。为此，首先根据所考虑的特定多时间图像的行为，在变化矢量分析(CVA)极域中提取RN。然后，对RN像素进行局部分析(即，对存在残差的控制点进行自动提取，并根据估计的位移进行匹配。匹配的CPs用于插值生成变形图。最后，通过变形图将一幅VHR图像扭曲到另一幅VHR图像的坐标。对仿真和真实的多时间VHR图像进行了实验，验证了该方法的有效性。

    In this paper, we present a novel domain adaptation technique aimed at providing reliable change detection maps for a series of image pairs acquired on the same area at different times. The proposed technique exploits the polar change vector analysis method and assumes that the reference data for characterizing a specific change of interest are available only for a pair of images (source domain). Then, it exploits the knowledge learned from the source domain and adapts it to other pairs of images belonging to the time series (target domains) to be analyzed. The proposed technique is able to handle possible radiometric differences among images adapting in an unsupervised way the decision rule estimated on the source domain to the target domains through variables estimated directly on the target images. The proposed approach has been applied to two data sets made up of time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper images. In one case, the change of interest is related to evolution of deforestation, while in the other case, it is related to burned area detection. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

    The increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) images regularly acquired over urban areas opens new attractive opportunities for monitoring human settlements at the level of individual buildings. This paper presents a novel approach to building change detection in multitemporal VHR synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed approach is based on two concepts: 1) the extraction of information on changes associated with increase and decrease of backscattering at the optimal building scale and 2) the exploitation of the expected backscattering properties of buildings to detect either new or fully demolished buildings. Each detected change is associated with a grade of reliability. The approach is validated on the following: 1) COSMO-SkyMed multitemporal spotlight images acquired in 2009 on the city of L'Aquila (Italy) before and after the earthquake that hit the region and 2) TerraSAR-X multitemporal spotlight images acquired on the urban area of the city of Trento (Italy). Results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows an accurate identification of new and demolished buildings while presents a low false-alarm rate and a high reliability.

    The problem of estimating the parameters of a Rayleigh-Rice mixture density is often encountered in image analysis (e.g., remote sensing and medical image processing). In this paper, we address this general problem in the framework of change detection (CD) in multitemporal and multispectral images. One widely used approach to CD in multispectral images is based on the change vector analysis. Here, the distribution of the magnitude of the difference image can be theoretically modeled by a Rayleigh-Rice mixture density. However, given the complexity of this model, in applications, a Gaussian-mixture approximation is often considered, which may affect the CD results. In this paper, we present a novel technique for parameter estimation of the Rayleigh-Rice density that is based on a specific definition of the expectation-maximization algorithm. The proposed technique, which is characterized by good theoretical properties, iteratively updates the parameters and does not depend on specific optimization routines. Several numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, which is general and can be applied to any image processing problem involving the Rayleigh-Rice mixture density. In the CD context,the Rayleigh-Rice model (which is theoretically derived) outperforms other empirical models. Experiments on real multitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images confirm the validity of the model by returning significantly higher CD accuracies than those obtained by using the state- of-the-art approaches.

    在图像分析(如遥感和医学图像处理)中，经常遇到Rayleigh-Rice混合密度参数的估计问题。本文在多时间、多光谱图像变化检测(CD)的框架下解决了这一普遍问题。基于变化矢量分析是多光谱图像中CD分析的一种常用方法。在这里，差分图像的大小分布可以用Rayleigh-Rice混合密度理论模型来模拟。然而，考虑到该模型的复杂性，在实际应用中，常常考虑高斯混合近似，这可能会影响CD的结果。本文提出了一种基于期望最大化算法的Rayleigh-Rice密度参数估计新方法。该方法不依赖于特定的优化程序，迭代更新参数，具有良好的理论性能。通过对合成数据的数值实验验证了该方法的有效性，该方法具有通用性，可应用于任何涉及Rayleigh-Rice混合密度的图像处理问题。在CD背景下，Rayleigh-Rice模型(理论推导)优于其他经验模型。在真实的多时间、多光谱遥感图像上进行的实验验证了该模型的有效性，所得到的CD精度显著高于采用最先进方法所得到的CD精度。

    The new generation of satellite hyperspectral (HS) sensors can acquire very detailed spectral information directly related to land surface materials. Thus, when multitemporal images are considered, they allow us to detect many potential changes in land covers. This paper addresses the change-detection (CD) problem in multitemporal HS remote sensing images, analyzing the complexity of this task. A novel hierarchical CD approach is proposed, which is aimed at identifying all the possible change classes present between the considered images. In greater detail, in order to formalize the CD problem in HS images, an analysis of the concept of "change" is given from the perspective of pixel spectral behaviors. The proposed novel hierarchical scheme is developed by considering spectral change information to identify the change classes having discriminable spectral behaviors. Due to the fact that, in real applications, reference samples are often not available, the proposed approach is designed in an unsupervised way. Experimental results obtained on both simulated and real multitemporal HS images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CD method.

    This paper presents an effective semiautomatic method for discovering and detecting multiple changes (i.e., different kinds of changes) in multitemporal hyperspectral (HS) images. Differently from the state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed method is designed to be sensitive to the small spectral variations that can be identified in HS images but usually are not detectable in multispectral images. The method is based on the proposed sequential spectral change vector analysis, which exploits an iterative hierarchical scheme that at each iteration discovers and identifies a subset of changes. The approach is interactive and semiautomatic and allows one to study in detail the structure of changes hidden in the variations of the spectral signatures according to a top-down procedure. A novel 2-D adaptive spectral change vector representation (ASCVR) is proposed to visualize the changes. At each level this representation is optimized by an automatic definition of a reference vector that emphasizes the discrimination of changes. Finally, an interactive manual change identification is applied for extracting changes in the ASCVR domain. The proposed approach has been tested on three hyperspectral data sets, including both simulated and real multitemporal images showing multiple-change detection problems. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    Even after coregistration, very high resolution (VHR) multitemporal images acquired by different multispectral sensors (e.g., QuickBird and WordView) show a residual misregistration due to dissimilarities in acquisition conditions and in sensor properties. Residual misregistration can be considered as a source of noise and is referred to as registration noise (RN). Since RN is likely to have a negative impact on multitemporal information extraction, detecting and reducing it can increase multitemporal image processing accuracy. In this letter, we propose an approach to identify RN between VHR multitemporal and multisensor images. Under the assumption that dominant RN mainly exists along boundaries of objects, we propose to use edge information in high frequency regions to estimate it. This choice makes RN detection less dependent on radiometric differences and thus more effective in VHR multisensor image processing. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, multitemporal multisensor data sets are built including QuickBird and WorldView VHR images. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RN identification approach compared to the state-of-the-art one.

    即使在共配准后，不同的多光谱传感器(如QuickBird和WordView)获得的非常高分辨率(VHR)多时间图像也会由于采集条件和传感器特性的不同而出现残留配准错误。剩余配准误差可视为噪声源之一，称为配准噪声(RN)。由于RN可能对多时间信息提取产生负面影响，因此检测和减少RN可以提高多时间图像处理的精度。在这封信中，我们提出了一种方法来识别RN之间的VHR多时间和多传感器图像。在主RN主要存在于物体边界的假设下，我们提出利用高频区域的边缘信息来估计它。这一选择使得RN检测较少地依赖于辐射差异，从而在VHR多传感器图像处理中更有效。为了验证该方法的有效性，建立了包括QuickBird和WorldView VHR图像在内的多时间多传感器数据集。定性和定量的评估都证明了与最先进的方法相比，提出的RN识别方法的有效性。

    This paper presents a novel multitemporal spectral unmixing (MSU) approach to address the challenging multiple-change detection problem in bitemporal hyperspectral (HS) images. Differently from the state-of-the-art methods that are mainly designed at a pixel level, the proposed technique investigates the spectral-temporal variations at a subpixel level. The considered change detection (CD) problem is analyzed in a multitemporal domain, where a bitemporal spectral mixture model is defined to analyze the spectral composition within a pixel. Distinct multitemporal endmembers (MT-EMs) are extracted according to an automatic and unsupervised technique. Then, a change analysis strategy is designed to distinguish the change and no-change MT-EMs. An endmember-grouping scheme is applied to the changed MT-EMs to detect the unique change classes. Finally, the considered multiple-change detection problem is solved by analyzing the abundances of the change and no-change classes and their contribution to each pixel. The proposed approach has been validated on both simulated and real multitemporal HS data sets presenting multiple changes. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    A novel multiscale morphological compressed change vector analysis (M(2)C(2)VA) method is proposed to address the multiple-change detection problem (i.e., identifying different classes of changes) in bitemporal remote sensing images. The proposed approach contributes to extend the state-of-the-art spectrum-based compressed change vector analysis (C(2)VA) method by jointly analyzing the spectral-spatial change information. In greater details, reconstructed spectral change vector features are built according to a morphological analysis. Thus more geometrical details of change classes are preserved while exploiting the interaction of a pixel with its adjacent regions. Two multiscale ensemble strategies, i.e., data level and decision level fusion, are designed to integrate the change information represented at different scales of features or to combine the change detection results obtained by the detector at different scales, respectively. A detailed scale sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate its impacts on the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is designed in an unsupervised fashion without requiring any ground reference data. The proposed M(2)C(2)VA is tested on one simulated and three real bitemporal remote sensing images showing its properties in terms of different image size and spatial resolution. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness.

The proposed approach aims at estimating and correcting the residual local misalignment [also referred to as registration noise (RN)] that often affects multitemporal VHR images even after standard registration. The method extracts automatically a set of object representative points associated with regions with homogeneous spectral properties (i.e., objects in the scene). Such points result to be distributed all over the considered scene and account for the high spatial correlation of pixels in VHR images. Then, it estimates the amount and direction of residual local misalignment for each object representative point by exploiting residual local misalignment properties in a multiple displacement analysis framework. To this end, a multiscale differential analysis of the multispectral difference image is employed for modeling the statistical distribution of pixels affected by residual misalignment (i.e., RN pixels) and detect them. The RN is used to perform a segmentation-based fine registration based on both temporal and spatial correlation. Accordingly, the method is particularly suitable to be used for images with a large number of border regions like VHR images of urban scenes. Experimental results obtained on both simulated and real multitemporal VHR images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    The change detection (CD) problem is very important in the remote sensing domain. The advent of a new generation of multispectral (MS) sensors has given rise to new challenges in the development of automatic CD techniques. In particular, typical approaches to CD are not able to well model and properly exploit the increased radiometric resolution characterizing new data as this results in a higher sensitivity to the number of natural classes that can be statistically modeled in the images. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for the description of the statistical distribution of the difference image as a compound model where each class is determined by temporally correlated class transitions in the bitemporal images. The potential of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the very common problem of binary CD based on setting a threshold on the magnitude of the difference image. Here, under some simplifying assumptions, a multiclass distribution of the magnitude feature is derived and an unsupervised method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm and Bayes decision is proposed. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large variety of data sets from different MS sensors. In particular, experimental tests confirm that: 1) the fitting of the magnitude distribution significantly improves if compared with already existing models and 2) the overall CD error is close to the optimal value.

    变化检测(CD)问题是遥感领域的一个重要问题。新一代多光谱(MS)传感器的出现给自动CD技术的发展带来了新的挑战。特别是，典型的CD方法不能很好地建模和正确地利用增加的辐射分辨率来表征新数据，因为这导致对可以在图像中统计建模的自然类的数量具有更高的敏感性。在本文中，我们介绍了一个理论框架来描述作为一个复合模型的差异图像的统计分布，其中每个类是由时间相关的类转换在双中心图像。在对差分图像大小设置阈值的基础上，针对常见的二值CD问题，证明了该框架的可行性。在一定的简化假设下，推导了星等特征的多类分布，提出了一种基于期望最大化算法和贝叶斯决策的无监督方法。它的有效性在来自不同MS传感器的大量数据集上得到了验证。特别是实验测试证实:1)与已有模型相比，星等分布的拟合有显著提高;2)CD总误差接近最优值。

    Change detection from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images enables mapping applications for earth environmental observation, human activity monitoring, and urban studies. We expand the use of SAR data beyond single-look processing to include the spatial response of targets. This information is derived from a multisquint framework similar to beamforming. To preserve changes detected at nominal resolution, a three-stage change detector exploiting single-look and multisquint processing mode is proposed to mitigate false alarms caused by image artifacts typically found in high-resolution SAR imagery and urban scenarios. After applying the proposed method to multitemporal images, the false alarm rate was reduced by a factor 3, while preserving 95% of the detection rate offered by traditional schemes.

    This paper proposes an approach for the detection of changes in multitemporal Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images acquired by different multispectral sensors. The proposed approach, which is inspired by a recent framework developed to support the design of change-detection systems for single-sensor VHR remote sensing images, addresses and integrates in the general approach a strategy to effectively deal with multisensor information, i. e., to perform change detection between VHR images acquired by different multispectral sensors on two dates. This is achieved by the definition of procedures for the homogenization of radiometric, spectral and geometric image properties. These procedures map images into a common feature space where the information acquired by different multispectral sensors becomes comparable across time. Although the approach is general, here we optimize it for the detection of changes in vegetation and urban areas by employing features based on linear transformations (Tasseled Caps and Orthogonal Equations), which are shown to be effective for representing the multisensor information in a homogeneous physical way irrespectively of the considered sensor. Experiments on multitemporal images acquired by different VHR satellite systems (i. e., QuickBird, WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    Change detection is one of the central problems in earth observation and was extensively investigated over recent decades. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional neural network (ReCNN) architecture, which is trained to learn a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation in a unified framework for change detection in multispectral images. To this end, we bring together a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) into one end-to-end network. The former is able to generate rich spectral-spatial feature representations, while the latter effectively analyzes temporal dependency in bi-temporal images. In comparison with previous approaches to change detection, the proposed network architecture possesses three distinctive properties: 1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most existing methods whose components are separately trained or computed; 2) it naturally harnesses spatial information that has been proven to be beneficial to change detection task; 3) it is capable of adaptively learning the temporal dependency between multitemporal images, unlike most of algorithms that use fairly simple operation like image differencing or stacking. As far as we know, this is the first time that a recurrent convolutional network architecture has been proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image analysis. The proposed network is validated on real multispectral data sets. Both visual and quantitative analysis of experimental results demonstrates competitive performance in the proposed mode.

    变化检测是地球观测的核心问题之一，近几十年来得到了广泛的研究。本文提出了一种新的递归卷积神经网络(ReCNN)结构，该结构训练在统一的多光谱图像变化检测框架下学习联合频谱时空特征表示。为此，我们将卷积神经网络(CNN)和递归神经网络(RNN)合并为一个端到端网络。前者能够生成丰富的光谱空间特征表示，而后者能够有效地分析双时间图像的时间依赖性。与以往的变化检测方法相比，本文提出的网络结构具有三个显著的特点:1)具有端到端可训练性，与现有的组件分别训练或计算的方法不同;2)自然利用已被证明对变化检测任务有益的空间信息;3)它能够自适应学习多时间图像之间的时间依赖关系，不像大多数算法使用相当简单的操作，如图像差分或叠加。据我们所知，这是首次提出一种用于多时相遥感图像分析的递归卷积网络结构。在实际多光谱数据集上验证了该网络的有效性。实验结果的可视化和定量分析都证明了该模型的竞争力。
